"The insurance market will soon force politicians to confront the realities of 'managed retreat' due to climate change. In the US, tens of millions of people live in disaster prone areas that will soon be uninsurable.","We've been used to seeing most climate change action taking place in terms of C02 reduction. Soon, we will have to confront a new course of action - managed retreat.

In the US, the potential damage from climate change intensified floods, hurricanes and wildfires could top $1 trillion in the years ahead. A 2018 insurance company report found that [a single Category 5 hurricane hitting Miami could cause $1.35 trillion in damages.](https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/americas-mounting-insurance-crisis)

[More and more, private insurance companies are refusing to deal with this.](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/09/home-insurance-wildfire-hurricane-coverage) Is the answer public insurance? Why should voters in 'safe' areas pay for people who deliberately choose to live in climate change dangerous areas? Perhaps 'managed retreat' to safer areas may be the more realistic option.

Some politicians have tried to behave as if climate change isn't happening. But that game won't work much longer, these are all about to become unavoidable issues.",Futurology,9582,928,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1i1unjs/the_insurance_market_will_soon_force_politicians/

"If we should blame anyone for the lack of action on Climate Change, it should be Greenpeace.","Because they killed the viability of nuclear power, the only power source that is clean and can produce enough power to meet our demands without needing to change much about the industry.

Because of their crusade on GMOs, which would feed millions of people and reduce the amount of farmland we would need exponentially. 

Because their use of bullshit alarmist talking points has become common practice among environmental activists and has caused several people to become apathetic towards a very important issue.

And because they are a bunch of twats whose publicity stunts irreversibly damaged a UNESCO Heritage Site and caused the deaths of millions because of their crusade against DDT.

They personify everything wrong with the environmental movement. They have essentially killed every viable strategy we have to combat our impact on the environment in the eyes of the public and ruined the perception of the movement as a whole. They are the reason we aren't doing jackshit about climate change, because their anti-science activism has ruined the reputation of every technology that could yield the most results.

Edit #1: A slight correction on the DDT point. It was only banned worldwide in 2001, but is still used in small quantities to combat large infestations of mosquitoes. It was also linked to several health defects in humans and animals. However, it doesn't change the fact that malaria kills 3000 children every day and that DDT is still the most effective way to combat it, at least in reasonable doses.

"People who think climate change is ""irreversible"" are just as counterproductive to climate action as climate change deniers","  
The only real solution to climate change is to restore Earths climate to its pre-industrial state by removing CO2 from the atmosphere after all human activities have been made carbon neutral. We changed the Earths climate so therefore the solution is to change the Earths climate back to what it used to be before human activities changed it. The conservation of matter law conclusively disproves the idea that any environmental problem can truly be irreversible because it proves that matter can exist in any physical or chemical form at any time. 

Unfortunately, there are many people who cannot grasp this concept. Such people are the people who think that climate change is ""irreversible"". These sorts of people are seemingly incapable of thinking logically about climate change and devoid of problem solving skills. These sorts of people are profoundly ignorant towards the full picture of climate change. The profound ignorance of people who think climate change is ""irreversible"" is just like the profound ignorance of people who think climate change is ""a hoax"". Both types of people act against efforts to address climate change. 

Once all human activities have been made carbon neutral, these are the ideal carbon removal methods which can be used to return the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere to 280 PPM 

\- Biochar 

\- Regenerative agriculture 

\- Enhanced Rock Weathering 

\- Turning biomass (ideally forest thinning waste) into fossil fuels and putting these fossil fuels back underground - [https://heatmap.news/technology/charm-forest-service-carbon-removal](https://heatmap.news/technology/charm-forest-service-carbon-removal) \- [https://recoal.net](https://recoal.net)  

\- Dissolving limestone in wastewater - [https://crewcarbon.com](https://crewcarbon.com) 

\- Killing and sinking harmful algae blooms - [https://carbonherald.com/first-ever-carbon-credits-from-toxic-algal-remediation-are-issued/](https://carbonherald.com/first-ever-carbon-credits-from-toxic-algal-remediation-are-issued/) 

\- Growing and sinking seaweed (seaweed can be farmed or natural) 

\- Producing carbon nanotubes from biogenic CO2 

People who think climate change is ""irreversible"" act as if these carbon removal methods do not exist. The fact is that these carbon removal methods do exist and have been proven effective by extensive research. The fault lies with people who hold the ""climate change is irreversible"" mindset. It is not there opponents (people like me who actually want climate change to be fixed) problem that they are incapable of understanding how carbon removal can be used to restore Earths climate. 

People who think climate change is ""irreversible"" should be treated the same way as people who think climate change is ""a hoax"". This stance on climate change should be considered just as counterproductive. We should put effort into actually fixing climate change instead of satisfying the emotional fetishes of those who cannot understand it.

I'm tired of being blamed for climate change as a consumer,"I know this might both be controversial to some and highly popular to others, but I'll try to be as nuanced as possible. 

Of course it's an easy stance to take, you shift any personal responsibility away to something else. But this is not what I am saying. I do believe that each consumer bears responsibility for what they buy to some degree. Personally, I am very cautious of my impact: I limit packaging as much as possible, I limit meat eating, I buy locally... But, besides the fact that this may make us feel good about ourselves, the impact is next to nothing. 

The whole ""supply and demand"" logic is misused in this context (I am not trying to discredit economic science): there is simply no demand for junk. Nobody wants to buy junk or products that are packaged in all sorts of single use plastics. People buy that shit because it is cheap and affordable. Indirectly, when we follow this flawed logic, we are blaming poorer people for their climate change impact, which is just plain wrong. 

At the moment, being able to ""buy responsibly"" is a privilege and a luxury. It is expensive as hell. I am financially comfortable enough to buy a product that is more expensive but has less environmental impact. People that do not have this financial comfort do not bear responsibility for the environmental impact of the products they are forced to buy. 

This has turned more into a rant perhaps than an opinion, but it truly angers me. When the UN Climate Change Report came, news articles talked about ""what can you do?"", ignoring the root of the problem. It's about corporate policies and legislative interventions. 

Rant example: packaging cans or bottles with plastic. Are we still in the 1950's? Haven't we seen enough marine animals suffocate in those? It's so easily solveable: use recycleable carton. Ban it, impose it, tax it: these are actions able to make an impact. 

***Don't misinterpret this as an excuse for no consumer responsibility. If you are financially comfortable, you bear responsibility for what you choose to buy.***",unpopularopinion,6121,660,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/pi9hdt/im_tired_of_being_blamed_for_climate_change_as_a/

China, India, other developing nations are the primary culprits of what the perceived problem actually is.  Focus your energy on them, not me.  

You're free to engage in any level of saving the earth you personally want, but don't burden me with your problems when I'm not contributing to the problem. If you're truly worried about the problem you wouldn't be holding the iPhone you're reading this on right now and you'd own no car.

Biden will move to implement his $2 trillion climate plan on day 1 to bolster the economy and kick off the new administration's fight against climate change,"Climate change is at the top of President-elect Joe Biden's funding agenda once he assumes office on Wednesday, as the new administration looks to add jobs to the economy while combating the warming climate.

In his $1.7 trillion climate proposal, Biden plans on reversing many of President Donald Trump's actions that relate to the climate on his first day in office, such as **rejoining the Paris Agreement, ending the Keystone XL pipeline, and establishing rules that limit methane emissions from oil and gas drilling operations. The proposals are also intended to boost the still-struggling economy, and by confronting climate change, 10 million clean energy jobs could be created if the proposal is successful.**

""If executed strategically, our response to climate change can create more than 10 million well-paying jobs in the United States that will grow a stronger, more inclusive middle class enjoyed by communities across the country, not just in cities along the coasts,"" Biden's website states. 

The climate was also high up on the agenda during the confirmation hearing of Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen on Tuesday. **Yellen told lawmakers that Biden's infrastructure plan will involve investing in clean technology, renewable energy, promoting electric vehicle usage, and creating jobs.**

**""Climate change is a critical problem facing the country, and President-elect Biden is committed to a wide range of policies to address it,"" Yellen said at the hearing. ""And in the process, making sure that in doing that we create good jobs for American workers.""**

**Yellen also said that Biden is in ""full support"" of restoring full incentives for electric vehicles, along with ensuring workers have the skills to succeed in the electric vehicle industry.**

Democratic lawmakers support federal spending for combating climate change. Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon said in Yellen's hearing that he hopes to advance a bill that will prioritize clean energy, clean transportation and energy conservation - efforts that address the ""existential threat"" of the warming climate.

Given the partisan nature of climate proposals over recent years, whether Biden can carry out costly climate initiatives is uncertain, but Yellen remains clear that it will be a priority, and will benefit the economy through job creation.",stocks,3496,579,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l0tiop/biden_will_move_to_implement_his_2_trillion/

AskScience AMA Series: We are climate scientists here to talk about the important individual choices you can make to help mitigate climate change. Ask us anything!,"Hi! We are Seth Wynes and Kimberly Nicholas, authors of a recent scientific study that found the four most important choices individuals in industrialized countries can make for the climate are not being talked about by governments and science textbooks. We are joined by Kate Baggaley, a science journalist who wrote about in [this story](http://nbcnews.to/2AjqKSL)

Individual decisions have a huge influence on the amount of greenhouse gas released into the atmosphere, and thus the pace of climate change. Our research of global sustainability in Canada and Sweden, compares how effective 31 lifestyle choices are at reducing emission of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases. The decisions include everything from recycling and dry-hanging clothes, to changing to a plant-based diet and having one fewer child.
 
The findings show that many of the most commonly adopted strategies are far less effective than the ones we don't ordinarily hear about. Namely, having one fewer child, which would result in an average of 58.6 metric tons of CO2-equivalent (tCO2e) emission reductions for developed countries per year. The next most effective items on the list are living car-free (2.4 tCO2e per year), avoiding air travel (1.6 tCO2e per year) and eating a plant-based diet (0.8 tCO2e per year). Commonly mentioned actions like recycling are much less effective (0.2 tCO2e per year). Given these findings, we say that education should focus on high-impact changes that have a greater potential to reduce emissions, rather than low-impact actions that are the current focus of high school science textbooks and government recommendations.
 
The research is meant to guide those who want to curb their contribution to the amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, rather than to instruct individuals on the personal decisions they make. 
 
Here are the published findings: [http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541/meta](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541/meta)

What better ways are there to protest climate change other than blocking the M25?,"Let me put it out there first of all; I do NOT agree with blockading major motorways or petrol stations as has happened in the past. 

From a logistics and emergency services point of view I can’t help but feel that such demonstrations are just downright dangerous and can cost lives. 

However there’s no denying that what they did made the media stand up and listen. 

So what better ways are there to raise awareness and protest without causing disruption and frustration to the general public. 

I have seen almost zero support for the m25 protesters from anyone other than other climate activists. 

Seems their actions pissed off the people who aren’t already on board/aware which kind of defeats the point and creates more friction than cohesion.

CMV: Most Americans don’t care enough about climate change to change their actions,"I only say Americans because I am one and don’t know enough about the culture outside America enough to make judgements. 

Climate change will cause terrible environmental changes that will cause millions to die/suffer from flooding, food shortages, etc. this will come to head in the coming decades. This is a fact.

To solve climate change we need to emit less co2 in the atmosphere. 

We can do that in America:
1. Eliminating single use plastics:

-Buying food at refillerys

-using glass and aluminum drinks

-companies will be fined/stoped for using wasteful plastic packaging

-right to repair will be law 

2. Banning the use private vehicles:

-every has to take the bus, train, or bike (unless they have great reason not to)

-the rich can’t use private planes

-banning new gas vehicles 

3. Nationalizing, regulating, rationing public utilities:

-Utilities will be free but rationed depending on need

-coal and natural gas power plants will only be used if renewables can’t (edit: I’m obviously down for nuclear)

-Anyone using too much ultilities will be fined/stopped

-helping other countries under America’s influence do the same

-banning single family detached housing 

-banning new housing too far outside a urban center

Doing this in America by itself will mitigate climate change greatly but most Americans are too self-involved to give up cars and single family houses.

Edit: -banning NEW single family detached housing
-for private vehicles small scale electric recreation vehicles are allowed 

Edit 2: Wow, this post got a lot of attention. Most people got caught up in the car thing. I specifically said “unless you have a great reason”. I didn’t say we are rounding up everyone’s cars and destroying them. Just the idea of using public transportation made many people visceral angry. (I also don’t appreciate the insults in my messages) That proved my point, many people wouldn’t change for the good of society. These measures if taken seriously would have to be done in like 10 year timeline. But for them to be done at all some people will have to sacrifice their time and comfort. Most people rather say climate change isn’t real or China is the problem. Before we criticize other countries let’s look at our selves. I understand we need regulations to fully do these things but why would regulations come if it looks like nobody cares. Also not all these things have to be done right away at one time. 

Long story short the sentiment I got from everyone is: 

Fuck you, I’m not changing it makes my life harder

Those solutions are drastic but i’m going to start making changes so we start a movement that starts mitigating the worse effects of climate change and pollution.

I study how the world's trees and soils are changing under the influence of human activity, and the consequences of these changes for on-going climate change. 

In 2016, we published a [paper](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v540/n7631/full/nature20150.html) revealing that atmospheric warming will drive the loss of approximately 55 gigatonnes of carbon from the soil into the atmosphere by 2050, with the potential to accelerate climate change by 17% on top of current expectations. We also [showed](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v525/n7568/full/nature14967.html) that there are over 3 trillion trees on Earth which are able to absorb much of this carbon, but their capacity to do so is being hindered by the loss of ~10 billion trees each year caused by deforestation, fire and disease/pests. Understanding and preserving these terrestrial ecosystems at a global scale is absolutely critical in the fight against poverty and climate change.

52% of Poles don't believe human activity is the main cause of climate change,"That's the highest percentage in the EU. 

It's despite incontrovertible evidence that human activity *is* the primary driver of climate change and overwhelming agreement on this amongst the vast majority of the world's climate scientists - people who've devoted their entire lives to studying this subject.

And it's despite the fact that the earliest acknowledgment that man-made carbon emissions contribute to climate change dates as far back as *1896* (!), when the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius calculated that doubling atmospheric CO2 could raise Earth's temperature significantly. (He linked coal burning to climate change, but in a striking contrast to today, saw it as a potential benefit in preventing future ice ages.)

So what explains it? I can guess a certain degree of religiosity. And I do detect a playfully contrarian streak in Polish thinking, which I encounter the whole time on any given subject. Is there anything else?

(Btw, that high percentage who don't believe in evolution is also OMFG)

EDIT: Well this was a shitshow. The majority saw the words “climate change” and simply bashed out their thoughts on climate change, which usually amounted to either “why I don’t care” or “why I don’t want to pay more to help solve it”. Those are not the questions I asked. My question was about perceptions of the CAUSES of climate change, not what / whether anything should be done about it, by Poles or anyone else ",poland,238,347,https://www.reddit.com/r/poland/comments/1iyhx6x/52_of_poles_dont_believe_human_activity_is_the/
Climate activism needs to be ramped up a hundred-fold or humanity is screwed,"***EDIT: Regardless of how pessimistic this post seems, I am NOT advocating for laying down and giving up. I'm pessimistic that anything will happen but I'm not giving up, and I'm also explicitly advocating for getting more people to do something about it.***

I'm sorry, but any attempt at baseless optimism won't really be conducive to climate efforts.

You should be panicked, and you should be using that frantic energy to ramp up your efforts, as should everyone be. I will admit that I'm not entirely guilt free in this. I could be doing a lot  more. Regardless, focusing on how it's ""not the end of the world"" isn't useful at all. It almost quite literally is, at least, the end of significant portions of humanity and global biodiversity. The situation is more dire than ever.

The article about how ""The AMOC won't fully collapse by the end of this century"" is cope. They're using the same data and framing it in an unrealistically optimistic way. The same data says that the current could slow down up to 80% by the end of the century. This is a functional collapse. WHY IS THE ARTICLE FRAMING THIS INFORMATION AS IF IT'S A CRISIS AVERTED?

The simple truth is that nothing will be done any time soon unless climate activism increases a hundred-fold. I'll be honest, I don't see that happening, and I'm two steps away from folding to the hopelessness and becoming a doomsday prepper. I just don't see a future in which the world collectively does anything against the ongoing crisis. The most they can do is bury their heads in the sand while focusing on attacking trans people and other marginalized communities while pocketing the money of their own supporters and the everyone else if more billionaires get in direct control of governments like Musk has with the U.S.

""Don't be an ~~doomer~~ alarmist,"" you say but we have to in order to make the waves that we need to at least somewhat mitigate the catastrophe. We need a thousand times more resources, popularity, and positive media coverage. Instead, any actual protests are going to be covered by the media as an extremist, alarmist, outright delusional group event as they strawman and misrepresent the climate struggle to high hell. All the while, the few billionaires controlling the narrative get richer off their oil money. Billions are going to die, a fact which is already baked in. Fascism is on the rise globally. Just a few days ago, the German far right party had a little over 20% support, giving them the second largest share of votes, right behind the conservative party who won the election with 28.52% of the votes. The scary part is that the German far right doubled its support of 10% in 2021 to 20% now in 2025.

It's clear that the far right is going to win, if not in the next election then the one after that, and it WILL have a huge impact on the rest of Europe considering that Germany is the largest economy in the EU. It's not just Trump. The rest of the world refuses to do what they need to in order to curb this catastrophe. The most marginalized people will see most of the effects while the ones who are benefitting from this won't experience anything until everyone else is actively fearing for their lives.",climatechange,435,140,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1iz1gl5/climate_activism_needs_to_be_ramped_up_a/

Beware of NC WARN - they claim to be climate change and clean energy advocates but actively work to block clean nuclear energy projects,"I started getting emails from this organization (https://www.ncwarn.org/) recently because I am getting rooftop solar installed.

I was happy to support an organization that is advocating in favor of rooftop solar and fighting against anti-solar policies being pushed by Duke Energy.

HOWEVER, NC WARN's views on nuclear energy are extremely short sighted and harmful. They are actively working to block new safe advanced small modular reactors, which would be an excellent stepping stone on the way from coal/gas electricity generation to 100% clean energy (whatever that looks like). They actively brag about stopping new nuclear development that would have boosted NC's clean energy footprint by a massive amount (https://www.ncwarn.org/about-us/history/):

> NC WARN has played an integral role in stopping the US nuclear “renaissance.” New reactors that Duke Energy planned at its Shearon Harris plant in Wake County were canceled in May 2013. In August 2017, reactors at Duke’s Lee station in South Carolina and SCE&G’s VC Summer plant in South Carolina were canceled.

I am a huge proponent of clean energy, hence the rooftop solar project, but at this juncture it's not practical to focus only on wind/solar. Our current energy mix includes nuclear energy (31 percent), natural gas (33 percent), coal (21 percent) and renewables (15 percent) based on 2021 data. Hoping to replace the 85% of capacity that is not already renewables with only renewables in a short time frame is not practical. Nuclear is already proven, it's already here, and it's far and away cleaner than coal or natural gas.",NorthCarolina,778,359,https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/w229md/beware_of_nc_warn_they_claim_to_be_climate_change/
How much climate change activism is BS?,"It's clear that the earth is warming at a rate that is going to create ecological problems for large portions of the population (and disproportionately effect poor people). People who deny this are more or less conspiracy theorist nut jobs. What becomes less clear is how practical is a transition away from fossil fuels, and what impact this will have on industrialising societies. Campaigns like just stop oil want us to stop generating power with oil and replace it with renewable energy, but how practical is this really? Would we be better off investing in research to develope carbon catchers?

"Climate change activism is inauthentic. If they really cared about the environment, the focus would be on pollution and habitat destruction, not carbon output.","My gripe with this whole ""climate change"" rhetoric is that:

1. yes, we are not being good stewards to the planet and our environment

2. yes, our activities are destroying biodiversity and priming us for an inevitable collapse

But at the same time, the priority should be on tangible and measurable metrics to prevent this destruction: 

1. habitat destruction because of deforestation and monocrop agriculture, things that everyday person isn't doing. This is all corporations' doing, and then we are blamed for ""climate change"" because we drove too many miles in a day
2. Pollution of oceans, air, and soil, which again is done mostly by corporations. People do some of it too, but never do you see pollution and clean up discussed in the context of ""climate change""

The point is that ""climate change"" is indefinable and vague. Just like ""public health"" and ""greater good"" that we saw during Covid, it's an abstract ideal whose definition can change at any moment, which allows the entities promoting it, like the world's government, to wield a seemingly infinite amount of power by changing the parameters of what it means as needed, and ultimately controlling everyone. This is the same ideal that all of the worst communist regimes in the world espoused: you have to do what's best for the ""state"" and everyone's ""greater good"". But because you can't even easily explain what this means, it just means you become a drone and do what you're told. This key tenet of past and present tyrannical regimes - an abstract and indefinable ideal - is exactly of the same shit cloth as ""climate change"" or ""global warming"" or whatever else branding they think of next. It sucks because yes we need to ""save the planet"" (to me this means preventing biodiversity loss, a measurable goal) but it starts with looking at things we can do right now like stopping deforestation and mass pollution, and not carbon taxing the poor people of the world. But because it would stand in a way of corporate greed and political exploitation, it will never be the focus.

Containing the following findings:

# The Atlas by region from 1970 to 2019

# Africa

\* 1,695 recorded disasters caused the loss of 731,747 lives and $5 billion in economic losses.

\* The continent accounts for 15 per cent of weather, climate, and water-related disasters; 35 per cent of associated deaths and one per cent of economic losses reported globally.

\* Although disasters associated with floods were the most prevalent, at 60 per cent, droughts led to the highest number of deaths, accounting for 95 per cent of all lives lost in the region, withmost occurring in Ethiopia, Mozambique and Sudan

# Asia

\* 3,454 disasters were recorded, with 975,622 lives lost and $2 trillion reported in economic damages.

\* Asia accounts for nearly one third, or 31 per cent of weather, climate, and water-related disasters globally, for nearly half of all deaths and one-third of associated economic losses.

\* Forty-five per cent of these disasters were associated with floods and 36 per cent with storms .

\* Storms took 72 per cent of of lives lost, while floods led to 57 per cent of economic losses

# South America

So, I wanted to start a discussion on this. Here are a few questions that come to mind. No need to answer all—just share your thoughts on whatever resonates with you, and explain your reasoning:

	•	Do you think climate change is real?

	•	Do you believe human activity, particularly CO2 emissions, is contributing to it?

If yes:

	•	Do you disagree with how the left is trying to address climate change? If so, why?

	•	Are there things you wish Trump would handle differently on this issue?

	•	What do you think are the best strategies to ensure future generations have access to similar resources and opportunities than we do? 

	•	Do you think the free market can solve climate issues better than government intervention? Why or why not?

	•	Are there any climate policies you support or would be open to if they were structured differently?

	•	What role do you think energy independence (oil, gas, nuclear, renewables) should play in addressing climate concerns?

[AMA Request] A Scientist Who Does Not Believe Climate Change is Real and/or Human Caused.,"**EDIT: I have been advised to clarify that I would be asking for a Climatologist or someone working in a relevant field to climate science, not just a general scientist. Also, I am using ""Climate Change"" in the sense it is used in the media, as in the significant change of the environment as a result of air pollution from human activity, which will cause a noticeable impact on the planet. NOT someone who doesn't believe climates change in general**

**My 5 Questions:**

1. How is your standing with your peers? Do they respect your position?

2. Where does your research funding go? Are there any ongoing projects you are working on in this matter?

3. How do you respond when evidence of human caused climate change is presented by other scientists? There are multiple ways to interpret a data set, what makes you think your interpretation is more valid?

4. Are you even pressured to change your view by political interests? Do you ever feel at risk of losing your job for your view?

5. Are you **opposed** to carbon reduction, or simply think it isn't necessary?",IAmA,8998,3380,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3r3b3g/ama_request_a_scientist_who_does_not_believe/
"Hello! We are young clean energy entrepreneurs going all-in to fight against climate change! With only a decade left to provide serious solutions, we are leaving our corporate jobs to create a platform to enable everyone to take a direct part in fighting climate change, and profit! Ask us anything!!","Hey guys! Thanks for tuning in! A few months ago, we launched our startup Terra2 to enter the ground floors of fighting climate change. Since then, we have raised almost $75,000 to fund our lean 8-team operation. At Terra2, we believe people want to fight climate change—they just don’t have the opportunity to easily participate.

· The United Nations [2019 climate report](https://www.unenvironment.org/interactive/emissions-gap-report/2019/) states that the world only has until 2030 to prevent catastrophic consequences from climate change. It’s almost on the verge of becoming impossible.

· Technological improvements in the last few years have made solar cheaper than natural gas, coal, wind, etc. ( [https://www.lazard.com/media/451086/lazards-levelized-cost-of-energy-version-130-vf.pdf](https://www.lazard.com/media/451086/lazards-levelized-cost-of-energy-version-130-vf.pdf))

· While investments into renewable energy are increasing, it’s not enough. We need to get more solar farms into the ground ASAP.

· Our goal is to open renewable energy to a new source of investment: you, the average investor! By accelerating the flow of capital into this space, we can build more solar farms faster and save the world before it’s too late.

Our solution is an online platform that lets everyday people quickly invest into solar farms, earn a return on investment (the profit from selling energy to power grids), and monitor carbon emissions reductions over time. We’re launching a beta platform later this year! Check out our website at [www.terra2.com](http://www.terra2.com/) and if you like what you see, please join the waitlist. We want to share our site visits and form submissions with investors so we can show them that this is a project with real demand worth funding. We’d also love any feedback, either positive or negative, so we can make improvements to our ideas as quickly as possible.

**Q: What do you provide that normal solar/energy ETFs dont?**

A: The plan is to build out a tech platform with features that will keep users actively engaged with their energy investments. With regards to returns, at this time, we can't give a projection on those numbers at this time. What we can say is that we will definitely aim to compete with the returns that ETFs provide with the hopes that they'll be appealing enough to incentivize users to use our platform!

**Q: Will you only operate in the U.S? Do you have plans for international projects?**

A: We'd definitely love to invest overseas but we chose to start in the States for now which we believe is a great target considering it's the second largest producer of emissions after China! We are definitely looking to expand overseas as soon as we can.

**Q: What do you mean we only have a decade left..?**

A: No, the world is probably not coming to an end in 10 years. However, [according to the 2019 Emissions Gap Report from the UN](https://www.unenvironment.org/interactive/emissions-gap-report/2019/), we are running out of time to reduce emissions to a point that would limit the increasingly severe environmental impacts of the future.

**Q: Why solar? What about other renewable sources?**

A: The costs for solar development have declined due to improvements in solar technology, making it more attractive as an investment offering. From a logistical perspective, at our current early stage for a team of our size with minimal resources, it makes sense to us to focus our efforts rather than risk spreading ourselves thin across multiple types and and not properly executing on any of them.

**Q: What can I do to help?**

A: A good first step would always be to do your own due diligence/research and understand for yourself the current state of the many environmental facts, as well as arguments out there, from both sides.

That being said there are a multitude of ways to contribute to positive environmental change. Our platform that we're creating is just but one of them that we hope will drive positive impact and that we hope you will support.

"Science AMA Series: We are scientists interested in climate change and are here to talk about the Peoples Climate March on April 29th. We are Dr. Michael E. Mann, Dr. Robert Bullard, and Ploy Achakulwisut. Ask us anything about the Peoples Climate March, climate science and why we march!","On the 100th Day of the Trump Administration, people will come together from across the United States in the streets of Washington D.C. to resist attacks on people, communities and our planet. We invite you to join the Peoples Climate Movement on Saturday, April 29th as we march to:

  *   Advance solutions to the climate crisis that are rooted in racial, social and economic justice and committed to protecting front-line communities and workers.

  *   Protect our right to clean air, water, land, healthy communities and a world at peace.

  *   Immediately stop attacks on immigrants, communities of color, indigenous and tribal people and lands and workers.

  *   Ensure public funds and investments create good paying jobs that provide a family-sustaining wage and benefits and preserve workers’ rights, including the right to unionize.

  *   Fund investments in our communities, people and environment to transition to a new clean and renewable energy economy that works for all.

  *   Protect our basic rights to a free press, protest and free speech.


My name is Michael E. Mann. I use theoretical models and observational data to better understand Earth's climate system. I’m perhaps past known for the so-called “The Hockey Stick” curve that my co-authors and I published in the late 1990s, which has become iconic in the public discourse human-caused climate change. The Hockey Stick quickly became a central object of attack by those looking to discredit the case for concern over human-caused climate change.  As I describe in my book ‘The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars’, many of attacks have been directed at me personally, in the form of threats and intimidation efforts carried out by individuals, front groups, and politicians tied to fossil fuel interests. I use my personal story as a vehicle for exploring the role of skepticism in science, the uneasy relationship between science and politics, and the dangers of special economic interests to skew discourse over policy-relevant areas of science.


I’m Dr. Robert Bullard. Some often describe me as the father of environmental justice. I have written eighteen books that address climate justice, environmental racism, and regional equity among many things. I have testified as an expert witness and served as a technical advisor on hundreds of civil rights lawsuits and public hearings over the past three decades.


I’m Ploy Achakulwisut. I'm a PhD candidate in Atmospheric Science. My research focuses on improving our understanding of the interactions between climate change and atmospheric chemical composition, important for climate and human health. Currently, I'm investigating how future climate change will affect levels of airborne dust in the western US. I'm also interested in climate policy, communications, and activism. I was a SustainUS Youth Delegate to the 2014 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference in Lima, Peru. For the past four years, I've co-organized several campaigns to mobilize scientists to engage in climate advocacy.

**UPDATED (1:00pm ET):** That’s our time for today and so we’re signing off. Thanks everyone for the great questions. We really enjoyed them and we hope our answers were helpful. Keep the conversation going here and on Twitter and Facebook. We’ll see you at the march!

Hi I’m an average guy who woke up an activist on November 9th and found this march:

 Tell EVERYBODY. Game on, April 29, 2017.

[Peoplesclimate.org](https://peoplesclimate.org/). 

Lets tell our representatives we want to **stay in the Paris Agreement!** If they don't, they'll see we're organized and will vote them out!

10 million strong, seriously. Aim high. ACT LIKE CHAMPIONS! LET'S DO THIS! And then at least feel like we've tried and done something historic, ya know? 
________

**Edit:**

To address concerns in the comments: **pledge to lower your CO2 spent to get to the march.** This sends a good signal, such as: train = if you can take a train. car = carpool. bus = rally bus. airplane = carbon offset (plant 25 trees per person). **Other ideas?** Especially for those who'd have to fly?

Let’s take an extreme scenario where a many people fly all the way across the country. That would cost at most in hundreds of thousands of metric tons of CO2 emissions. [carbon calculator](http://calculator.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx?tab=3) 

Staying in the Paris Agreement **reduces carbon emissions by BILLIONS of metric tons and puts us on a sustainable course for good.**

The top grey dotted line in [this info graphic](http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/US-emissions-chart.jpg) is if the Paris Agreement with American participation doesn’t happen. Game over.

_________

[Peoplesclimate.org](https://peoplesclimate.org/) are the same folks that organized the biggest climate march to date in 2014 with hundreds of thousands. Now they’re at it again, on April 29th 2017 right before Trump's 100 days.

Are there other groups that combine environmental organizations that you know of? If so, who? Get them to join this march! 

Are there other marches scheduled that others don't know of yet? How can we combine them into one massive showing?

I think his election is scaring many of us (myself being an example) into activism mode, rather than assuming our gov is taking care of the problem (like the Paris global initiative Obama put together that Trump threatens to dismantle).

INVITE EVERYONE WHO ALREADY CARES

Peoplesclimate.org is a combo of dozens of organizations, including 350.org, as seen at bottom of page. Let's help them add even more to the list. 

**Invite Bernie** and his millions on board, all democrats and more Environmental Organizations.

Invite DiCaprio who made the powerful documentary Before the Flood, and has millions of twitter followers. 

And other passionate media folks and celebrities who can reach the masses. If you happen to know any, invite them!

And the Clintons, and Gore. If this is really about the preservation of our planet, it's wake up time.

Reach out to younger people in their 20s and even High School, who will inherit this planet. 

Reach to all environmental organizations and get them to join this march, like The Sierra Club and … ?

How about religious organizations? Even the POPE spoke out recently!!! This involves ALL OF US. This is something we can all agree and come together on!

__________
REACHING OUT TO MODERATE CONSERVATIVES

I've actually seen on reddit that moderate conservatives, many who voted Trump, still believe in climate change. I think we should make it a CENTRIST issue. Take out the political charge, and base it in stewards of our earth and country. Reach across the divide, why not? Have some real conversations based in fact. Know the economic concerns of those who push back against regulation and acknowledge them, and support them in adapting.

Recent reddit comments brought up the fact that if sea level rise doesn't scare em into action, which may not matter as much to those inland as it does on the coast, then reframe it to the impact of stronger storms and tornados, and droughts on crop production. And overall the impact on our economy if the coastal cities and towns are under water.

We need republican support in congress to move the needle. and if not, then they need to be afraid of getting reelected.

This fella is trying, for example: [Jay Faison's Quest to Save the Planet (And the GOP)](http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-11-01/jay-faison-s-expensive-maddening-quest-to-save-the-planet-and-the-gop)

______________
MASSIVE MOVEMENT BRINGS EDUCATION AND ACTION

10 million people marching. I'm not even kidding. 20 million Muslims just marched in Iraq against ISIS. 2 million marched in South Korea against their president. If they all can organize in face of a dire threat, so can we.

In addition to marching, just organizing into a mass movement can spread actionable ideas. Educating people on the low hanging fruit, the easier first steps towards reducing emissions in our day to day choices. 

If millions organize and speak with our votes and dollars ... support green initiatives and companies, then we fight through governmental and capitalist methods. 

The carbon tax for example is the biggest government move. We need to educate ourselves on a deeper level on the real issue(s), like the pros/cons of the carbon tax. I understand it could hurt business profit, which is the reason for so much push back. And that we're taking on more of the burden as part of the Paris Accord then the rest of the world, is another push back I've read. We need intelligent answers to these issues. 

And Climate Denial? The Pentagon and NASA have published proof of our impact on Climate Change. We need to counter the vocal deniers.  But we already have the numbers for massive action. There’s a reason why Obama was able to align 197 countries in the Paris Agreement.

We fixed the ozone layer, we've increased fuel efficiency, and safety. We can do this heavy lift, even if it imposes on profit, if it's necessary to support life on freaking earth!

Did the rise of inflation kill any political momentum for aggressive climate change initiatives?,"I find it quite interesting that the concept of climate change at all was almost completely absent from the presidential election and national conversation as a whole. Other than a few brief remarks when a hurricane hits or a question at a debate climate change as a political issue as almost evaporated.

This is a marked shift from 8 years ago when Trump was pilloried for saying climate change is a hoax and for pulling out of the Paris climate accord. 

Now the GOP terrified senate candidates in the blue wall states running aggressive ad campaigns saying the democratic party was going to ban gasoline cars. The attacks were so severe that Michigan Senate Candidate Elissa Slotkin released her own ad disavowing the claim of banning gas cars and saying she drives a gas car too. In previous years trumps statements of aggressive drilling And boosting energy production through the roof would’ve been challenged by democrats citing carbon emissions, but in 2024 any such pushback was non existent. 

What happened to climate change as a salient political issue? Did the activist movement just fizzle out. The voters not really believe in the supposed theory of accelerated transition away from fossil fuels as the only hope of survival? Did the rhetoric from the climate activists reach such apocalyptic levels that people just don’t believe them anymore? Do people still believe in it but just can’t afford to care if it means gas prices will increase? How did climate change die as a political issue?",PoliticalDiscussion,77,115,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/1gmxz8p/did_the_rise_of_inflation_kill_any_political/
Global Warming in the year 2025,"# International News: Global Climate Crisis Intensifies Following U.S. Withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord

The global response to climate change suffered a significant setback with the United States’ official withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord, a landmark international agreement aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions and limiting global temperature increases. This decision marks a culmination of years of domestic debate, economic interests, and political maneuvering. The administration argued that the agreement imposed disproportionate economic burdens on American industries while allowing leniency for major developing nations like China and India. Critics contend that this withdrawal reflects a politically driven rejection of scientific consensus, risking severe consequences for global environmental governance and solidarity.

>The withdrawal occurs against a backdrop of increasingly urgent climate challenges. Recent data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reveals that global temperatures have already risen by 1.98°F (1.1°C) since 2000, with projections indicating an additional increase of 4.86°F (2.7°C) by the end of the century—far exceeding the Paris Accord’s target of 2.7°F (1.5°C). The year 2023 was particularly alarming, as Death Valley, California, recorded a blistering 134°F, the highest reliably measured temperature on Earth.

**The Paris Climate Accord: A Global Effort at Risk**

Established in 2015 and signed by nearly 200 countries, the Paris Climate Accord is the most ambitious global initiative to combat climate change. It set comprehensive targets to prevent catastrophic warming and mitigate climate-related risks:

\- Limit global temperature increases to below 3.6°F (2°C) and aim for 2.7°F (1.5°C)

\- Achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050

\- Provide $100 billion annually to assist developing nations in adapting to climate impacts and transitioning to renewable energy sources

*“The U.S. withdrawal undermines global consensus on climate action,”* stated ***Dr. Helena Martens***, a leading climate policy expert. *“This decision not only diminishes America’s leadership role but also sets a dangerous precedent that could unravel years of progress.”*

**Immediate and Long-Term Ramifications**

The absence of U.S. leadership in the global climate arena has far-reaching consequences. The vacuum left behind raises concerns about the capacity of remaining nations to meet their climate commitments in a coordinated manner.

1. Global Leadership Gap: Historically one of the world’s largest emitters, the U.S. withdrawal leaves a leadership void that countries such as China and the European Union are attempting to fill. However, questions persist about whether these efforts will adequately compensate for the lost momentum.
2. Economic and Environmental Fallout: The World Resources Institute warns that failure to meet Paris Accord targets could result in $1.5 trillion in annual global economic losses by 2050, driven by escalating natural disasters, food insecurity, and infrastructure degradation.
3. Rising Sea Levels and Extreme Weather Events: Coastal regions are increasingly vulnerable to frequent flooding, while heatwaves, wildfires, and prolonged droughts have become regular occurrences. Small island nations, including the Marshall Islands and Maldives, face existential threats due to rising sea levels.

*“The climate crisis is no longer a future threat—it’s an unfolding catastrophe,”* emphasized ***Ban Ki-moon,*** former Secretary-General of the United Nations. *“Decisions made today will determine the livability of our planet for generations to come.”*

**International Reactions and Strategic Responses**

The global community’s reaction to the U.S. withdrawal has been one of disappointment and determination. World leaders have reaffirmed their commitment to the Paris Agreement and pledged to intensify efforts to achieve its goals.

\- ***President Emmanuel Macron*** of France described the U.S. withdrawal as *“a grave error with catastrophic consequences”* and emphasized the European Union’s intent to double its carbon reduction initiatives.

\- China’s Ministry of Ecology and Environment announced enhanced emissions reduction targets, aiming for carbon neutrality by 2060, thereby positioning itself as a global leader in climate diplomacy.

\- Small island nations, in a joint statement, called for urgent action, highlighting that they are on the frontlines of the climate crisis.

Despite the federal government’s withdrawal, several U.S. states and municipalities have pledged to uphold the principles of the Paris Accord independently. California, for example, has reiterated its goal to achieve 100% renewable energy by 2045.

*“We will not stand idly by,”* said ***Governor Gavin Newsom*** of California. *“States have the power to lead, and we are committed to protecting our communities and the planet.”*

*Acorn of the Day: Climate at a Crossroads*

*🌰 Will the U.S. withdrawal inspire greater international self-reliance and resilience, or will it signal a fragmentation of the global climate effort, leaving vulnerable populations exposed to the harshest consequences?*

Let's get Trump to accept climate change,"Does anyone want to help me make a website solely dedicated to getting Trump to accept climate change? 

Edit: Thanks to everyone who messaged me willing to help. I'll try to respond to all of you. I'm not quite sure what my plan is right now but I'm definitely going to go through with this. 

Edit 2: I'm just a college engineering student on a busy schedule so I don't really have time to organize a huge movement, but the ideal scenario would just be to get a bunch of really smart and well connected people to talk about a way to make this happen. 

I think that there's two main things that need to be accomplished.

1) Trump needs to learn the full extent of the problem of climate change. From what I know of Trump he doesn't seem to be very ideologically rigid on any issue, so convincing him of climate change shouldn't be as hard as convincing other republicans. 

2) We need to sell the conservative argument for investing in clean energy, having a carbon tax, and keeping climate agreements and other measures for slowing climate change.

So my initial thought was to make some sort of website focused on selling the conservative argument for climate change, with a forum where people can talk about ways to get the message out to Trump. I'm totally open to any other ideas though so please feel free to PM me your input. 

I know its a long-shot that this will accomplish anything, but I figured I might as well do something to make a fucked up situation slightly better.

Edit 3: Since there's so many people willing to help I'm making a group where we can all discuss the logistics, more to come.

Edit 4: I created a group on Slack. If you want to help in any way PM me your email address and you'll be added.

Edit 5: If anyone is interested, since the time of making this post what started off as a loose idea is starting to turn into something very real. We've got a team of about 30 people of diverse skillets and interests, and we're really starting to get the wheels rolling on this project. Right now our goal is to create a simple, elegant website that aims to play a crucial role in creating more widespread support for climate change policy. In particular, we're going to sell a ""business pitch"" of sorts to Donald Trump, that America's blue collar jobs crisis, heavily divided political atmosphere, and falling place in advancement can all be solved by investment in the clean, renewable energy industry. 

Also, if you're still looking to join our team, make sure to include some relevant skills that you could add. I'm thrilled with the amount of people wanting to help, but I'm hesitant to add everyone because I'm concerned our organizing body could become too large and unwieldy to start.",environment,22223,924,https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/5byi0k/lets_get_trump_to_accept_climate_change/
"Science AMA Series: I’m Prof. Thomas Malone, from the MIT Climate CoLab, a crowdsourcing platform to develop solutions to climate change, part of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence. AMA!","If there ever was a problem that’s hard to solve, it’s climate change. But we now have a new, and potentially more effective, way of solving complex global challenges: online crowdsourcing. 


In our work at the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence, we’re exploring the potential of crowdsourcing to help solve the world’s most difficult societal problems, starting with climate change. We’ve created the Climate CoLab, an on-line platform where experts and non-experts from around the world collaborate on developing and evaluating proposals for what to do about global climate change. 


In the same way that reddit opened up the process of headlining news, the Climate CoLab opens up the elite conference rooms and meeting halls where climate strategies are developed today. We’ve broken down the complex problem of climate change into a series of focused sub-problems, and invite anyone in the world to submit ideas and get feedback from a global community of over 34,000 people, which includes many world-renowned experts.  We recently also launched a new initiative where members can build climate action plans on the regional (US, EU, India, China, etc.) and global levels. 


Prof. Thomas W. Malone: I am the Patrick J. McGovern Professor of Management at the MIT Sloan School of Management and the founding director of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence.  I have spent most of my career working on the question of how new information technologies enable people to work together in new ways.  After I published a book on this topic in 2004 called The Future of Work, I decided that I wanted to focus on what was coming next—what was just over the horizon from the things I talked about in my book.  And I thought the best way to do that was to think about how to connect people and computers so that—collectively—they could act more intelligently than any person, group, or computer has ever done before.  I thought the best term for this was “collective intelligence,” and in 2006 we started the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence.  One of the first projects we started in the new center was what we now call the Climate CoLab.  It’s come a long way since then!


Laur Fisher:  I am the project manager of the Climate CoLab and lead the diverse and talented team of staff and volunteers to fulfill the mission of the project. I joined the Climate CoLab in May 2013, when the platform had just under 5,000 members.  Before this, I have worked for a number of non-profits and start-ups focused on sustainability, in Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Sweden and the U.S.  What inspires me the most about the Climate CoLab is that it’s future-oriented and allows for a positive conversation about what we can do about climate change, with the physical, political, social and economic circumstances that we have.

"AskScience AMA Series: I spent the last year investigating the potential of carbon-capture technology (or ""clean coal"") to mitigate climate change. Ask me anything!","Under the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, the world has agreed to do what is needed to keep global temperatures from not rising above 2 degrees C as compared to pre-industrial levels. According to the International Panel on Climate Change, in every economically viable scenario to that goal, the world needs to deploy carbon-capture technologies on large scale.

These technologies allow us to keep burning fossil fuels almost without emissions, while putting us on the trajectory to hit our climate goals. They are considered a bridge to a future where we can create, store, and supply all the world's energy from renewable sources. But carbon-capture technologies have a tortured history. Though first developed nearly 50 years ago, their use in climate-change mitigation only began in earnest in the 1990s and scaling them up hasn't gone as planned. 

My initial perception, based on what I had read in the press, was that carbon capture seemed outrageously expensive, especially when renewable energy is starting to get cheap enough to compete with fossil fuels. At the same time, my training in chemical engineering and chemistry told me the technologies were scientifically sound. And some of world's most important bodies on climate change keep insisting that we need carbon capture. Who should I believe?

The question took me down a rabbit hole. After a year of reporting, I've come to a conclusion: Carbon capture is both vital and viable. I've ended up writing nearly 30,000 words in The Race to Zero Emissions series for Quartz. 

You can read the 8,000-word story where I lay the case for the technology here: https://qz.com/1144298; other stories from the series here: https://qz.com/re/the-race-to-zero-emissions/; and follow the newsletter here: https://bit.ly/RacetoZeroEmissions.

Please stop saying *No One* is doing anything about Climate Change,"I know we all are frustrated that more is not being done to combat climate change, however saying that \*no one\* is doing anything to work on climate change is actively discrediting those people who are and claiming that we are all doomed and the world will end is not a motivating statement to actually work on fixing climate change. 

I actively work on climate change, I have taken a reduced salary that I could have working on getting oil onto the market to instead help fix the climate change problem and there are hundreds of thousands of others (or millions if you include people working overtime manufacturing solar panels and wind turbines, and EVs and such, and even billions we expand it globally to those funding solar projects through taxes and other investments in climate initiatives).

As someone working overtime and earning less than I could be to help solve climate change its infuriating to just hear how kids in school and people elsewhere are being told that \*no one\* is doing anything to solve it. 

If you want to actually help, then bring attention to those who are standing in the way but give credit to those who are working on the problem. Bring attention to the wealthy NIMBYs who are blocking renewable projects like offshore wind, or mass transit projects (through the use of B.S. environmental lawsuits), or those blocking higher density housing which has a far lower carbon footprint than sprawling suburbs, or those blocking research projects or brainwashing others claiming that climate change isn't real, etc... Be angry at those people, but don't say that \*no one\* is working on it. 

In spite of those people standing in the way we have beaten all of our renewable energy goals and dramatically reducing costs of deployment (it's now cheaper than coal and natural gas), we are dramatically reducing the cost for carbon capture technologies (still have a ways to go with this and need a carbon tax to fund it, but progress is progress and takes a lot of hard work and money), we are even making significant breakthroughs in technologies like nuclear fusion energy (see commonwealth fusion and others) which would easily make mass scale desalination and water transport feasible, GMOs are enabling crops to be resilient for climate change to prevent famines, we're working global monitoring satellite systems to rapidly detect oil spills (and enforce environmental fines) as well as other carbon emissions, people are working hard on developing carbon neutral building materials, we're adopting EVs faster than most projected, battery technology is booming with massive investments in building supply, and there's a ton of other stuff happening to, we just passed a 3 huge bills that each work on climate change in their own ways funding over $600 billion to combat it and reduce costs to implement solutions everywhere.

TL:DR - There are tons of people working hard on combating climate change and investing massive sums of money into the problem and they deserve credit. Point out the bad actors, but don't say that \*no one\* is working on the problem, its discrediting to those who are and unmotivating to the future generation. We aren't doomed, we just need to keep working hard, humans have survived worse with less countless times in the past.",Futurology,1803,601,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/11auj14/please_stop_saying_no_one_is_doing_anything_about/

CMV: EV's (for personal use) are one of the worst things to happen to climate policy because they offer a faux solution to the car problem and eat up a ton of resources.," 

EV's at the moment are objectively unsustainable and impossible to implement at a large scale. There's not enough lithium and our grid isn't developped enough.

They're a gadget upper middle class people buy for themselves to virtue signal and political parties that build policy aruond them are being disingenuous. They take away from real policies that could combat car use like investing in public transport and bike lanes. 

I do think they can have a use in the transport sector but i don't think we should be wasting lithium on toys for rich people that are only barely less destructive to the climate then normal cars are.

A lot of European countries are banning the sale of non-electronic vehicles in 2030. This seems to me a ""poor people can't have a car"" rule. I have a feeling a lot of the batteries that could have been used for electronic bicycles are gonna be used for electric cars which will make the price of those skyrocket.",changemyview,2005,664,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/tcbmiq/cmv_evs_for_personal_use_are_one_of_the_worst/

I am a member of a team that has created and is now building support for a U.S. energy policy centered around avoiding the worst impacts of climate change. AMA,"Frustrated by the U.S.'s lack of progress on climate solutions, we created a six-point plan to remedy the situation. Our strategy recognizes that President Obama's Climate Action Plan isn't enough to avoid the worst climate impacts, and lays out specific policies that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the levels that the best scientists say is necessary.

Our document is called *The Plan: How the U.S. Can Help Stabilize the Climate and Create a Clean Energy Future,* and is broken down into 2 categories: actions that President Obama can legally take on his own, and ones we must pressure Congress to pass.

We know this is an ambitious undertaking–but we're trying to push the politics of climate change because the planet can't afford to wait around while our politicians dither.

"Science AMA: I’m Seema Jayachandran, economist at Northwestern University. Let me tell you why paying poor farmers to not cut down forests is a cheap way to combat climate change. AMA about why small amounts of money for Ugandan farmers helped preserve endangered chimp habitat, and the atmosphere.","Hi Reddit!

My name is Seema Jayachandran, and I’m an economics professor at Northwestern University, specializing in low-income countries.

I am affiliated with the Poverty Action Lab at MIT (J-PAL), which has championed the use of randomized controlled trials to study the effectiveness of social/economic policies. I am also affiliated with Innovations for Poverty Action, who was our partner for data collection in Uganda for the research I am here to talk about.

My collaborators and I just [published a paper in Science](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6348/267),
 [short summary here](http://www.poverty-action.org/study/testing-effectiveness-payments-ecosystem-services-enhance-conservation-uganda), that evaluates a program in Uganda that paid individuals to keep their forest intact. Most of the forest is owned by poor farmers who have been cutting trees to sell to timber or charcoal dealers as an extra source of income, or to use the cleared land for growing crops. As a result, the forest is disappearing at one of the fastest rates seen anywhere in the world. The Ugandan government wanted to protect the forest to save chimpanzees and other endangered species, whose habitat is dwindling.

Preserving forests has another big benefit for all of us: It keeps CO2 out of the atmosphere. Trees naturally absorb and sequester CO2 from the atmosphere as part of photosynthesis.  The carbon they are storing is emitted into the atmosphere when they are burned or decompose. Paying forest owners to keep their forests intact is thus one way we can reduce global CO2 emissions.  Furthermore, offering a payment and making the program voluntary means that, unlike under a ban, we are not making poor people worse off. This approach (called “Payments for Ecosystem Services” or PES) has been used in Costa Rica and elsewhere, but there has been a lot of skepticism about whether it actually works (for reasons I’m happy to discuss).

We decided to rigorously test how well PES works using a randomized trial; some villages got the program, and some didn’t. A Ugandan conservation non-profit called [CSWCT](http://www.ngambaisland.org/pes-project) ran the program, and we evaluated the program’s impacts. We compared the amount of deforestation in villages with the program (treatment group) to the ones without it (control group) using satellite imagery.  This is the first time PES has been tested with the randomized controlled trial method.

Bottom-line finding: The program saved a lot of forest. We converted that gain in forest into a quantitative dollar benefit to the world from the delayed CO2 emissions (I’m happy to explain more about how we did that). The climate-change benefits were more than twice the program costs. Our findings don’t mean PES will work always and everywhere, but they should make us more bullish on it. IMO, rich countries should be upping their funding for programs that pay people in poor countries to preserve forests. We need to reduce CO2 emissions, and this seems like a bargain way to do it.

The study was widely covered, [including by the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/20/climate/a-cheap-fix-for-climate-change-pay-people-not-to-chop-down-trees-uganda.html), [the Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/07/paying-people-to-preserve-their-trees/534351/), [InsideClimateNews](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/20072017/stopping-deforestation-payment-ecosystem-services-trees-uganda-climate-change), and [Popular Science](http://www.popsci.com/uganda-deforestation-pay).  Northwestern was kind (or mean) enough to post a [short video interview](https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2017/july/cash-for-carbon-a-cost-effective-way-to-reduce-deforestation/) with me as well.

TL;DR In a first-of-its-kind controlled experiment, paying poor Ugandans not to cut down their forests created twice the value in avoided climate costs as was spent on the program.  We should do it more.

I’ll be back at ~12:00 ET to answer questions!

"Science AMA series: I'm Brian Buma, Assistant Professor at the University of Alaska. I study forest disturbances around the world, focusing on emerging mortality associated with climate change and carbon/water/forests as an integrated system. AMA!","Hi reddit!

I am a disturbance ecologist (think fires, windstorms, landslides) that primarily studies the response of forested ecosystems to emerging disturbances triggered by climate change.  I'm particularly interested in how resilient forests may be to these new stresses - and if that resilience is a good thing.  Will our forests recover from future disturbances?  What will that recovery look like?  Does this recovery – or lack thereof – help or hinder species ability to migrate in response to climate change?  What new disturbances are emerging?  

One striking example of all of these issues is the emerging mortality of species along the remote southeast Alaskan and Canadian west coast, where 400,000 ha (so far) of trees have died due to low snow conditions brought about by warming winters.  The cause is surprisingly related to freezing – the soil is no longer insulated by snow, so cold snaps can kill.  This is an emerging disturbance that we are just beginning to study, and it’s dramatically changing the forest community.  But it also appears to be associated with migration in other, less climate sensitive species.  So perhaps this disturbance, and others, are facilitating the migration of species into more favorable climates.  It’s a complex ecological story of adaption/maladaptation and creative destruction (so to speak), and great fun to investigate.

Most of my work involves a focus on either forest biodiversity, forest carbon, or water resources, and I've worked in Hawaii, the Rocky Mountains, and Alaska, and collaborated on projects around the world using a combination of fieldwork, remote sensing/satellites, GIS, and modeling.  I am also the caretaker of what is believed to be the longest running permanent study plots studying primary succession in the world in Glacier Bay, Alaska (100 years and counting).  So the data comes from a lot of sources, and I'm happy to discuss integration of methods as well.

For more info, [check out this website.](www.brianbuma.com)

**I will be answering  your questions at 1 PM  ET, AMA!**


Edit:  Thanks everyone!  Some really interesting and thought provoking questions in here, and it's humbling and exciting to see so many people concerned and interested in the state of the world's forests.  There were lots of great ideas for next steps, projects, etc mentioned here and I'd love to hear how those progress.

I have to run for a meeting but I'll check back in tonight (it's only 1PM in Alaska right now, after all, lots of time) and keep on doing what I can.   

Edit 2:  And I'm back for a bit.  This is really fun.  

...off for dinner.  Will log in later to reply further.  

In the meantime, most of my work is posted on my website, and for those great questions about coastal forests I would encourage you to check out the Alaska Coastal Rainforest Center (http://acrc.alaska.edu/) for all things coastal forest related.  Feel free to email with questions as well, I'm always looking for interested students and research collaborations, in addition to partners in management and policy.

Alrighty, it's late in Alaska, so I'm done (and Denzel is online...).  Thanks so much for your questions!

*The current system has raised billions of people out of poverty. Human population will peak by the 2050's and decline afterwards. Demand for resources will decrease. Why make dramatic changes now?*

*The growing consensus is that Covid originated from a lab leak. A bunch of scientists worried about a future pandemic tried to research viruses and may have inadvertently caused the worst man made disasters in human history.*

*Not saying that the theory is proven.*

*But you could say that it has a relation to environmentalism. A bunch of people thinking they will do good end up making everything worse because they wanted to force people into dramatic action.*

We need to make ALOT of sacrifices to reduce c02 footprint, we can't afford to wait for some miracle power generator to be invented. We are already to late to the 'party'.*

*Corporations produce what people buy. They don't emit GHGs for fun.*

*This is why it's stupid when people allocate all blame to the companies. They obviously need to improve their practices, don't get me wrong, but the best thing people can do is not buy heavy climate impact products like beef or palm oil. Reducing demand for these products will mean fewer are produced and emissions are avoided.*

&#x200B;

*True, but they dont emit the lowest possible amount of pollutant possible either. Because a corporations end goal is not to keep our planets resources in check. It's about making money, and money only. But every product should have been labeled by it's 'impact on climate' by now. The reason we don't, i guess is because the largest companies do not want this kind of rating system. Because they will score poorly.*

People need to know that none of us are coming out of this unscathed, but we can still make things better, mitigate the damage, curtail the costs which WILL be incurred in the form of losses when the stock markets cease functioning because wall street is under water and unpredictable weather that makes agriculture impossible for extended periods of time outstrips our saved provisions.*

When you point at the failures of the USSR and China, you make a false equivalency to make your point seem valid, but all you’ve done is drop a red herring and reinforced a false stereotype about socialist policies.*

*We can all see capitalism in its death throws and it’s sickening, we are at a point where so few own to much that there is nothing left over for the majority of us and it’s only getting worse.

People are literally killing themselves over failing at capitalism and how social expectations are creating unseen levels of mental instability.*

*It’s a system that doesn’t work and will only end in fascism. Fascism is the logical end of capitalism when fueled by militant nationalism and corporate moral ambiguity (aka we are whining new babies off mothers milk to make a profit, because we only answer to our shareholders).*

*But surely you recognize that, regardless of whether these past socialist systems ever achieved ""communism"" or not, that is precisely what they were attempting to do, right? And it didn't work.*

*So until you can prove that this transition is actually possible and won't fail like it has in the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Albania, Poland, Vietnam, Bulgaria, Romania, Czechoslovakia, North Korea, Hungary, China, East Germany, Cuba, Tanzania, Laos, South Yemen, Somalia, the Congo, Ethiopia, Cambodia, Mozambique, Angola, Nicaragua and Venezuela, then I'll take capitalism.*",SubredditDrama,3633,534,https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/o168v3/i_dont_deny_climate_change_and_it_needs_to_be/

#Fed nominee 

Sarah Bloom Raskin, Biden’s nominee to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, has [withdrawn](https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/15/business/sarah-bloom-raskin-withdraws/index.html) herself from consideration for the position after key senators opposed her nomination. 

Bloom Raskin faced extensive criticism from the right for her belief that climate change exists and the Federal Reserve has a role to play in mitigating its effects. Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee have [boycotted](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-03/gop-senators-dig-in-on-boycott-of-rankin-fed-vote-in-committee) attempts to advance her nomination since her hearing last month. 

>“We just want them to show up for work,” [Committee Chair Sherrod Brown] [said](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-fossil-fuel-companies-are-stonewalling-sarah-bloom-raskins-nomination-to-the-fed) of his Republican colleagues. “In the midst of an attack, the Russians attacking Ukraine… they’re saying we’re not going to confirm the chair of the Federal Reserve, the vice-chair of supervision, the vice-chair of the Fed, and the other two governors.” He added, “We can’t run the Senate this way.”

However, the pressure against her also came from a specific Democratic senator - Joe Manchin, of West Virginia. According to Manchin, Bloom Raskin “failed to satisfactorily address my concerns about the critical importance of financing an all-of-the-above energy policy to meet our nation’s critical energy needs.” In other words, she was not an aggressive enough supporter of expanding fossil fuel production and utilization.

Last year, Bloom Raskin wrote in an [op-ed](https://law.duke.edu/news/op-ed-raskin-urges-us-financial-regulators-use-their-tools-mitigate-climate-risk/) that “the changing climate’s unpredictable – but clearly intensifying – effects on the economy” requires regulators to “ask themselves how their existing instruments can be used to incentivize a rapid, orderly, and just transition away from high-emission and biodiversity-destroying investments.” This is not a radical position to take; [84%](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/laser-talks/economists-consensus-on-climate-change/) of economists believe that global warming presents a clear danger to the US and global economies. Furthermore, “98% agreed that a market based solution could achieve significant reduction in carbon emission while spurring development in a new, more efficient, energy industry.”

---

#Electric cars

Fresh off killing Bloom Raskin’s nomination, we also learned that Manchin attended an energy conference over the weekend where he disavowed electric vehicles. 

>“I’m very reluctant to go down the path of electric vehicles,” Manchin said at the energy conference CERAWeek, held in Houston. “I’m old enough to remember standing in line in 1974 trying to buy gas – I remember those days. I don’t want to have to be standing in line waiting for a battery for my vehicle, because we’re now dependent on a foreign supply chain, mostly China.”

>“I’ve read history, and I remember Henry Ford inventing the Model-T, but I sure as hell don’t remember the US government building filling stations,” Manchin said to applause. “The market did that.”

First, the high oil and gas prices we’re currently seeing, plus the west’s reliance on oil from despotic nations, make a strong counter argument to concerns about standing in line for gas.

Second, if Manchin is afraid of Chinese dominance of battery supply chains, government investment is the answer. 

Finally, the market hasn’t single-handedly created the oil and gas distribution network we see today. The fact is that the U.S. government [provides](https://www.eesi.org/papers/view/fact-sheet-fossil-fuel-subsidies-a-closer-look-at-tax-breaks-and-societal-costs) $20 billion per year in direct subsidies to the fossil fuel industry; 20% to coal and 80% to natural gas and crude oil.

Manchin’s opposition to electric vehicles further imperils any attempt by Congress to address climate change in a meaningful way. Before the Build Back Better Act was gutted by Manchin and Sen. Krysten Sinema (D-AZ), Democrats [included](https://consumerbrandsassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Fact-Sheet-on-EC-Build-Back-Better-Key-Provisions-.pdf) $13.5 billion to construct electric vehicle infrastructure and support electrification of industrial and medium-heavy duty vehicles. 

---

#Drill baby drill

The governor of Manchin’s home state, Jim Justice, has also taken advantage of the Russian war in Ukraine and its effect on fossil fuel prices. 

In numerous press conferences since the Russian invasion, Justice has loudly advocated for increased drilling and mining, even using a Covid-19 press conference to preach about God’s intention to fix climate change for us.

>”Now just think about this just for a second. Today the very resources that we have—coal, oil, and gas—our fossil fuels are now on the brink, really, of possibly preventing if not saving the world… Today, whether it be nuclear or hydrogen or windmills or solar panels—all of those we want to embrace, and I'm there—but they're the parsley around the side of the plate. The meat and potatoes are our gas, our oil, and our coal.” ([clip](https://youtu.be/C7-38fDRacA?t=322))

Then, two days later, Justice said *if* climate change is even real, God will save us ([clip](https://youtu.be/jkxpRpFz6OE?t=2047)).

>”I believe it is absolutely frivolous to think that today we can do in this country or this world without fossil fuels, and if we believe that we’re going to have just what the hand has dealt to us right now. We’re going to have chaos, we’re going to have real problems. … I believe, and my belief as strong is it may be, or can be, I believe with all in me, that we’ll have time and [God] will give us time as we go forward. If there is such a thing, and I underline if, if there is such a thing as climate change, I believe that he will give us time and the smart people will fix it. But today, today energy is being used as a weapon. This country, hands down, needs to be totally energy independent. It is a crying, pitiful shame to see what has happened under the Biden administration in trying to absolutely cripple us. We have become weak, have we not?”

Of course, like Manchin, Justice [owes](https://www.npr.org/2019/04/10/711361672/governor-and-his-family-owe-millions-in-mining-violations-despite-promises-to-pa) a large part of his fortune to coal mines.",Keep_Track,3199,172,https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/tgapej/joe_manchin_blocks_climatefriendly_fed_nominee_wv/
CMV: We can solve global warming in time ,"I was having a conversation with a friend about global warming and he said it was a depressing topic because there is nothing we can do. I think that is untrue, there are plenty of small things one can do. 

While small changes one makes in the US may not account for much considering we are no longer the top emitter of greenhouse gases, and because the largest emitters are not consumers but industry, it seems like it would add up to at least be able to get us close to not adding any more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Especially as green technologies such as wind and solar are maturing. 

However, it seems like to reverse global warming we need to also be removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which seems like it may be difficult to do with today’s technology (I mean plants naturally remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere).

**Hello there, /r/Science!**

We* are a group of researchers who just [published a meta-analysis](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048002) of expert agreement on humans causing global warming. 

The lead author John Cook has a video backgrounder on the paper [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pEb49cZYnsEl), and articles in [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/consensus-confirmed-over-90-of-climate-scientists-believe-were-causing-global-warming-57654) and [Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists](http://thebulletin.org/yes-there-really-scientific-consensus-climate-change9332). Coauthor Dana Nuccitelli also did a background post on his blog at the Guardian [here](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/apr/13/its-settled-90100-of-climate-experts-agree-on-human-caused-global-warming). 

You may have heard the statistic “97% of climate experts agree that humans are causing global warming.” You may also have wondered where that number comes from, or even have heard that it was “debunked”. This metanalysis looks at a wealth of surveys (of scientists as well as the scientific literature) about scientific agreement on human-caused global warming, and [finds that among climate experts, the ~97% level among climate experts is pretty robust](http://i.imgur.com/oCevIhE.jpg). 

The upshot of our paper is that [the level of agreement with the consensus view increases with expertise](http://i.imgur.com/L7xpRny.png). 

When people claim the number is lower, they usually do so by cherry-picking the responses of groups of non-experts, such as [petroleum geologists](http://www.climatesciencewatch.org/2013/02/14/james-taylor-misinterprets-study-by-180-degrees/) or [weathercasters](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/dec/02/meteorologists-global-warming-consensus). 

Why does any of this matter? Well, there is a growing body of scientific literature that shows the public’s perception of scientific agreement is a “gateway belief” for their attitudes on environmental questions (e.g. [Ding et *al.*, 2011](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v1/n9/full/nclimate1295.html, [Aklin and Urpelainen, 2014](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901113002141), [van der Linden *et al.*, 2015](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118489), and more). In other words, if the public thinks scientists are divided on an issue, that causes the public to be less likely to agree that a problem exists and makes them less willing to do anything about it. Making sure the public understands the high level of expert agreement on this topic allows the public dialog to advance to more interesting and pressing questions, like what as a society we decided to do about the issue. 

We're here to answer your questions about this paper and more general, related topics. We ill be back later to answer your questions, Ask us anything!

This is not a rant about global warming…however…spent the weekend in Lake Geneva.,"The Great State of Wisconsin gets an enormous amount of revenue from tourism year round, right!? I see all this rain today and higher temps and just reminisce about how much snow this could have been, and snowmobiling, and ice fishing, and skiing and it’s sad to look out the window. I miss the cold and snow and all the fun it brought with it. I’m surprised the entertainment industry hasn’t pooled resources to lobby for environmental action. Too little too late though right…it will never be like it was?!

EDIT: I really don’t have too many posts that generate much interest, so I was a bit surprised to see, and read the comments. I appreciate everyone who took the time to offer their experiences/history.

AskScience AMA Series: We're the scientists who figured out cutting methane emissions can avoid 0.3°C of global warming by 2045. Ask us anything!,"Hi everybody

We are the scientists behind a recent UN report on the impacts of methane emissions on climate change around the world. This report is called the Global Methane Assessment and you can download the whole thing [here](https://www.ccacoalition.org/en/resources/global-methane-assessment-full-report).

Here are the headline findings:

The Global Methane Assessment shows that human-caused methane emissions can be reduced by up to 45 per cent this decade. Such reductions would avoid nearly 0.3°C of global warming by 2045 and would be consistent with keeping the Paris Climate Agreement's goal to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (1.5˚C) within reach.

Because methane is a key ingredient in the formation of ground-level ozone (smog), a powerful climate forcer and dangerous air pollutant, a 45 per cent reduction would prevent 260 000 premature deaths, 775 000 asthma-related hospital visits, 73 billion hours of lost labour from extreme heat, and 25 million tonnes of crop losses annually.

We are:

+ Drew Shindell - Professor of Earth science at Duke University
+ Jean-Francois Lemarque - Director of the Climate and Global Dynamics (CGD) Laboratory at the National Center for Atmospheric Research
+ Johan Kuylenstierna - Research Leader at the Stockholm Environment Institute
+ Bill Collins - Professor of Climate Processes at University of Reading
+ Nathan Borgford-Parnell - Science Affairs Coordinator at the Climate & Clean Air Coalition

Methane doesn't always get the attention that it deserves, so we were pleased to see the [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/24/climate/methane-leaks-united-nations.html), [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/urgent-methane-cuts-needed-rein-climate-change-un-says-2021-04-27/), [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-56933443), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/06/cut-methane-emissions-rapidly-fight-climate-disasters-un-report-greenhouse-gas-global-heating) and many others highlighting our report - but now we're here to dive into the details.

Why hasn't the Maker fixed global warming?,"In Ultimate Universe: One Year In (the one with Nick Fury narrating most of it), there's a guy complaining that it's 90 degrees in January and it didn't used to be this way. Why does Maker's 'better world' still have this issue?

For all his egregious personality flaws, Maker's a Marvel-style supergenius with over 900 years of experience testing whatever the hell he wants to in his City. There's no way he's un*able* to come up with some kind of clean, cheap energy source. And as the head honcho of the *entire world* who screws with history for fun and profit, he definitely has the power to implement that clean energy worldwide and establish whatever infrastructure it requires.

But instead we have oil pipelines messing up Hawkeye's home, smog-spewing factories in the Savage Land, and 90-degree Januaries.

What does the Maker gain from allowing this? It's not like he can just kick the pollution can down the road for future generations to deal with, he's biologically immortal. He will *still be ruling* those future generations in his own best-case scenario. So why is perfectly fine with the kind of stunts that would make a Captain Planet villain blush?

I get that the *out of universe* reason is so the audience can be sad and angry about climate change and cheer for the good guys when they stop the bad guys from polluting. But what's the *in-universe* reason for this state of affairs?

  
Edit: I wrote this on the assumption that he needs this Earth *inhabitable* but it's occurred to me he really doesn't. He's still got his slices across other Earths as backups. Plus if it gets too bad, he can implement a solution *only then* and get a massive PR win out of it.",UltimateUniverse,42,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/UltimateUniverse/comments/1j0pzte/why_hasnt_the_maker_fixed_global_warming/

The Logical Argument for the Inevitability of the Collapse of Modern Civilization in the Context of Global Warming,"\[Edit: TL;DR for those of you who get lost in the fog of my, admittedly, opaque text - Collapse is inevitable because everything we have to do to keep our modern civilization functioning is at the same time increasingly destroying our ability to keep it functioning. \]

This is something I've been working on for awhile. It's the condensed logical argument for why the collapse of modern civilization is inevitable. I'm sure it needs work as this is only the first draft, but it didn't make sense to proceed further unless the framework made sense. The short of it is that our efforts to adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change as well as the growth of modern civilization are dependent on fossil fuels and as long as we continue to use them at a rate greater than the earth can remove them, we increase the rate of disasters that eventually degrade the foundations of modern civilization until it collapses, because at some point, the rate of degradation exceeds the rate of mitigation, adaptation, and growth.

I'm looking to know whether or not this is sound and how I can improve it. I know there's things that aren't in it (like I said it's a condensed framework) like population and economics and their effects on availability of resources, but those seemed to be sub-sections of the main argument which I've tried to outline.

All criticisms are welcomed. I'd like to hear your thoughts.

1. Average global temperature is increasing due to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases and the loss of earth’s albedo.
2. Increases in the average global temperature will lead to greater variability and changes in weather and greater climate extremes
3. Agricultural production and distribution, water storage and treatment, available housing, manufacturing and extractive capacity, logistical and electrical infrastructure are the foundational systems of modern civilization that are built on static infrastructure.
4. When the greater variability of weather interacts with the static infrastructure of modern civilization built for a time period of less weather variability and lesser climate extremes, it will cause disasters destroying the static infrastructure. 
5. Disasters degrade the overall quality and quantity of the foundational systems of modern civilization until the static infrastructure can be rebuilt or repaired, but the capacity to repair and rebuild is dependent on the foundational systems of modern civilization.
6. As the foundational systems of modern civilization are degraded, a greater amount of energy, part of which will come from fossil fuels, will be required to counteract the effects of their degradation, which will increase the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
7. As disasters occur at a greater rate due to an increase in average global temperature, the degradation of the foundational systems of modern civilization occurs at a greater rate which degrades the ability to repair and rebuild the static infrastructure at a greater rate.
8. Carbon capture, increasing earth’s albedo, and deflection of solar radiation are the ways available to mitigate existing and future climate change and are dependent on the logistical and electrical infrastructure, manufacturing and extractive capacity, political institutions, and labor of a civilization that are degraded as climate change accelerates, the acceleration being due to tipping points triggering natural feedbacks. 
9. The degradation of the ability of civilization to mitigate existing and future climate change reduces the rate of mitigation, which increases the length of time to stabilize our climate, and narrows the window to take action to stave off the worst effects of climate change.
10. As long as the rate of degradation to the systems needed to mitigate existing and future climate change is greater than the sufficient rate of mitigation to oppose the rate of degradation, the systems will continue to degrade and reduce the rate of mitigation.
11. As the systems needed to mitigate existing and future climate change are degraded, a greater amount of energy, part of which will come from fossil fuels, will be required to counteract the effects of their degradation, which will increase the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and extend out the timeline for mitigation. 
12. Humans as a whole will not willingly use less materials or energy and by not willingly doing so will continue to increase human greenhouse gas emissions because the main method for extracting, manufacturing, and transporting raw materials and intermediate and finished goods will continue to use fossil fuels as an energy source and emit greenhouse gases.
13. Repairing and rebuilding the static infrastructure of the foundational systems of modern civilization, increasing the quantity of systems needed to mitigate existing and future climate change to increase the rate of mitigation of the effects of climate change, and the inability of humans to willingly use less materials and energy all increase greenhouse gas emissions. 
14. When the rate of greenhouse gas emissions from all sources exceeds the earth’s capacity to remove them from the atmosphere, there is a net increase in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.
15. As long as degradation of systems need to mitigate existing and future climate change out-paces our ability to mitigate the effects of climate change, there is a net increase in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, and the earth continues to lose albedo and thereby absorbs more thermal energy from the sun, the earth will continue to warm and the intensity and frequency of climate change related effects will continue to increase. 
16. As the intensity and frequency of climate change related effects continues to increase, it will negatively impact the welfare of human populations, regional ecosystems, and the foundational systems of modern civilization. 
17. As the negative impacts of climate change increase, our ability to mitigate current and future climate change is degraded and our ability to mitigate the negative effects of climate change are degraded, the negative impacts to the systems foundational to our modern civilization accumulate.
18. As the negative impacts to the systems foundational to our modern civilization accumulate, modern civilization will reach a critical point where those systems fail.
19. When the systems foundational to our modern civilization fail, modern civilization will collapse. ",collapse,50,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1ispmwm/the_logical_argument_for_the_inevitability_of_the/

Climate Change scare funding.....,"I think that when it comes to ""climate change"", our Earth goes through cycles of warming and cooling.  Kind of like the heat droughts of the 1930's and 1950's.  The 1940's weren't the coldest either. Then things start cooling off through the 1960's-1980's.  There were always exceptions even in these times.  Then things start to warm back up 1990's, level out a bit then big heat and droughts 2011-2013.  In my view, we are starting to level off and maybe are in store for us to start cooling back off like similar scenario in the 1960's.

They say that these ""arctic outbreaks"" are a cause of global warming.  Kind of like the 2021 cold outbreak that caused record setting severe freeze far south. I don't get it how they can say we ""are warming"" but will have still have severe cold outbreaks.   I can remember some winters in the 1990's that were warmer than they were now.

What I don't agree with is funding for ""scare tactics"" to say that we are causing climate change in our Earth.  I think that's part of the problem why the power went out in some southern states in the last major freeze.  I'm sure these climate people are saying ""ahh your not going to have any of the 1970's 80's Winters anymore"", you don't need to worry about enough power for a cold wave.

They always go on and ramble about ""global warming"" and climate change.   If we are ""warming"" or cooling"" then we are and there's not a lot we can do . I am in no way smart enough to predict the future, but what will happen will happen and I don't think we can control it by ""changing or reducing greenhouse gasses"".  If we are ""warming"" then guess we will be warming. Could I be off and we have no sea by 2050? Yes. Could we have more sea ice and colder temps by 2050? Yes.  We don't know.

Climate scientists are wrong about how fast global warming will occur.,"There's already been a few dire predictions in the early 2000s that didn't pan out.   I think climate scientists are just as bad as economists at predicting anything.

But my main rationale for this is from past global warming history.   During the Permian-Triasic extinction event, CO2 levels shot up to 2500ppm.

From peak CO2 to peak warming, it didn't take years.  or even decades.  or even centuries.  It took 10,000-12,000 years.

Current CO2 levels are about 425ppm

Liberals are much more effective than Conservatives at convincing people that Climate Change is a scam.,"I'm a millennial who's been a believer in Climate Change all my life, up until late 2021. I used to believe Trump's biggest policy weakness (prior to Covid) was saying that Climate Change was a Chinese hoax. When Republican Senator Inhoffe brought a snowball to the Capitol, I thought he was the biggest clown in the world's biggest circus.  But Conservatives have already been labeled as ""Climate Deniers""- of course they'd say those things- so nothing they do really moves the needle on this issue.

But then you look at the liberals/Democrats:

* [""We're all going to die in 10-12 years!""](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2019/01/22/ocasio-cortez-climate-change-alarm/2642481002/) Five years later, they're still saying we're going to die in 10 years. Literally every doomsday climate prediction has failed- it's like listening to religious nuts talk about the rapture.
* Literally every hurricane in Florida is caused by ""Climate Change"". (Well shit, Florida's always had hurricanes- so has the climate just always been changing?)
* Dr. Greta Thunberg is an ""expert"", but she's clearly incapable of a single, independent thought. When asked [why she only denounces Western oil companies, but not OPEC or Russia](https://twitter.com/KatieDaviscourt/status/1616488713705652224) (FFS Russia...), she choked up and ignored the question, because she can't go off-script even a tiny bit. (A normal person who finished school would easily say, ""Yes, fuck 'em both."")
* The ""97% consensus"" (Cook et al) cited by politicians is a flat-out lie. The only consensus is that human activity causes greenhouse gasses, and greenhouse gasses cause warming- that does not automatically mean it will change the climate. The ""consensus"" does not take into account the millions of ways Earth has of cycling through these greenhouse gasses.
* Fly private jets literally everywhere they go (including and especially so-called Climate Summits), but shame on you for driving your car.

And then you look at all the ""solutions"" they propose- and they don't make a lick of sense regarding Climate Change

* The Central Maine Corridor project seeks to fully electrify the state of Massachusetts. They will do it by **cutting down the last great forest of the east coast**, because those pesky trees get in the way of the power lines they seek to build.
* Building a single electric car requires A LOT of fossil fuels and industrial mining. Most electric cars still get their power from **coal plants**. Liberal politicians already acknowledge this, but no one has a viable solution that can be implemented by 2030 (the targeted year to ban gas-powered cars)
   * Politicians **know** that there is not enough rare metals on earth to replace every gas-powered car with an EV. The ONLY way they can fully electrify automobiles is 1) pricing out the middle class or 2) straight-up banning cars
* Strong opposition to nuclear energy, despite it being the only viable no-carbon solution. It was only in 2020 that Democrats finally stopped opposing it openly, but it's clear they have no interest in advancing it.
* Eating meat bad, but mono-cropping soybeans good!
* Climate change is (possibly) killing polar bears? We have to do something!!! Wind farms are killing endangered eagles and whales? Well fuck 'em!
* Now the newest shit: A startup called [**Make Sunsets**](https://makesunsets.com/) wants to **fucking block out the sun** by releasing aerosol toxins into the air. Biden already announced he was considering this as a viable solution. WTF??? Does no one notice this is just straight-up air pollution?
* Black Rock assigns ESG scores to companies and nations based on ""Climate Change"" initiatives-- but simultaneously pushes people to invest in China (by far the biggest carbon producer) as much as possible, even when Covid made it clear China is definitely not a reliable business partner.

Last but not least, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm was the last nudge I needed to finally accept Climate Change as the scam it is. She shows zero subtlety in the fact that she profiteers off this agenda. She invests in EV companies despite her high position, a blatant conflict of interest. [She laughs at the idea of high gas prices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seIyfixWTGw), even during a much needed economic recovery.

Understanding Climate Change Denial?,"I should start by saying that while i do consider myself to be relatively moderate on the political spectrum, I do always like to keep an open mind, hear everyone out. I am trying to understand why so many people deny climate destabilization in one form or another. While i don't want to make group generalizations, i do understand that climate change denial is prevalent among the conservative body, hence me raising this point in a conservative subreddit. I understand the multiple apposing debates denying this issue, them being:
1. Climate change doesn't exist at all
2. Climate change exists but it's a natural and cyclical occurrence
3. Climate change is directly linked to human based activity, but its affects are either not of concern, or too far in the future to take considerable economic action. I have done what i consider to be extensive studies about climate properties, how greenhouse gasses affect atmospheric properties, and the potential outcome that an altered atmospheric composition can bring about(granted I am not a climatologist). l'd also like to point out that I do try as hard as possible to look at this objectively and don't allow political bias to affect my opinion. Through all of my findings, i've personally deduced that climate change, though it is a natural phenomenon that has been going on for as long as earth's current general climate
has existed, the rate at which we've seen the post-industrial global average temperature rise is alarming. The added greenhouse gases increase the amount of heat being absorbed in the atmosphere, which leads to other runaway outcomes that can compound to create issues like increased natural disasters, drought, flooding, sea level rise, decrease in arable land-potentially causing food insecurity. While i understand the economic impact of adapting to technologies like a sustainable energy grid is immense, i still see it as necessary in order to secure our comfortable and relatively stable way of life in the not so distant future (decades, not centuries or longer). What I would like to understand, and the reason for my post is: Why do so many people still deny the issue as significant? what stage of the process do people fall off? is it believing the science? is it a rejection of access to credible information? is it accepting the economic presssure as necessary? I try to still respect people that don't share my beliefs, but i can't help but think denial is at the very least irresponsible, not just to future generations, but to the later part of younger current generations lives. I don't want to get into specific facts and figures in my initial post, but one that persuaded me to believe the financial burden is acceptable is a figure that estimates combating natural disasters in the united states is predicated to jump 2-3x by 2050, that's going from around $100B a year to $200-300b a year, and potentially
astronomically higher by the end of the century.
Of course I encourage everyone to do their own research on this, and cross check facts across multiple sources. I am welcoming all feedback and would love to hear peoples opinions on this, I do just ask to have basic levels of respect, as I would ask of anyone regardless of the matter at hand.",AskConservatives,10,218,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskConservatives/comments/1cynv5w/understanding_climate_change_denial/
Why do some people think humans have no effect on global warming while the greenhouse effect and it's gasses are understood?,"I was wondering what is the reasoning for some people thinking that mankind's activities have no effect on global warming when we understand that the greenhouse effect warms planets (like Venus or Mars) and that greenhouse gases are the reason for this. Since carbon dioxide for example is a greenhouse gas, why is it thought by some people that humans releasing extra carbon dioxide would not increase the greenhouse effect and therefore increase the temperature of the planet?",AskScienceDiscussion,13,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceDiscussion/comments/6egy2p/why_do_some_people_think_humans_have_no_effect_on/
"#GEI [South East] Youma returns to the campaign trail to talk climate change policy
","Our world is facing a crisis like no other. The Climate crisis that we are in is one that will define our era, our actions, and our deeds will be told to future generations. We must protect this planet against ourselves and greenhouse gasses, and that is what the Liberal Democrats will do. That is what I will do for you.



The core plan for tackling climate change is how we create our energy. We simply can not rely on fossil fuels anymore. We must go green when it comes to our energy to stop polluting our air and skies with greenhouse gasses. We will heavily invest in offshore wind turbines, unlocking the wind potential that is off our coast. We will turn this wind into energy, into electricity for us to harness. We will also introduce subsidies for the installation of rooftop solar panels. This will have two results. One: more green energy on the grid. And two: people can use their own generated energy and sell it back to the grid, alleviating the pressures of the cost of living.



In line with our fight against the dirty polluting fossil fuels we will be looking at transport. We will replace all public transport with electric vehicles by 2050.  And we will start this replacement programme immediately. Fossil fuel vehicles are pollution creators and are a large and growing industry. It is important that we lead the green revolution from the front, and we will be doing this with our public vehicle replacement programme. 



By combining greener electricity generation with moving vehicle fuel from fossil fuels to electricity we will be tackling the crisis head on. The Liberal Democrats will make this planet better for the future and for you.

100 Reasons Climate Change is a Naturally Occuring Phenomenon (NOT Manmade),"“*It’s easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled”
~ Mark Twain*

HERE are 100 reasons (among many more) why climate change is natural and not man-made, released in a dossier issued by the European Foundation:

1. There is “no real scientific proof” that the current warming is caused by the rise of greenhouse gases from man’s activity.
2. Man-made carbon dioxide emissions throughout human history constitute less than 0.00022 percent of the total naturally emitted from the mantle of the earth during geological history.
3. Warmer periods of the Earth’s history came around 800 years before rises in CO2 levels.
4. After World War II, there was a huge surge in recorded CO2 emissions, but global temperatures fell for four decades after 1940.
5. Throughout the Earth’s history, temperatures have often been warmer than now, and CO2 levels have often been higher - more than ten times as high.
6. Significant changes in climate have continually occurred throughout geologic time.
7. The 0.85°C increase in the average global temperature over the last hundred years is entirely consistent with well-established, long-term, natural climate trends. 
8. The IPCC theory is driven by just 60 scientists and favorable reviewers not the 4,000 usually cited.
9. Leaked e-mails from British climate scientists - in a scandal known as “Climate-gate” - suggest that that has been manipulated to exaggerate global warming
10. A large body of scientific research suggests that the sun is responsible for the greater share of climate change during the past hundred years.
11. Politicians and activists claim rising sea levels are a direct cause of global warming, but sea levels rates have been increasing steadily since the last ice age 10,000 ago
12. Philip Stott, Emeritus Professor of Biogeography at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London says climate change is too complicated to be caused by just one factor, whether CO2 or clouds
13. Peter Lilley MP said last month that, “fewer people in Britain than in any other country believe in the importance of global warming. That is despite the fact that our government and our political class - predominantly - are more committed to it than their counterparts in any other country in the world”.
14. In pursuit of the global warming rhetoric, wind farms will do very little to nothing to reduce CO2 emissions
15. Professor Plimer, Professor of Geology and Earth Sciences at the University of Adelaide, stated that the idea of taking a single trace gas in the atmosphere, accusing it and finding it guilty of total responsibility for climate change, is an “absurdity”
16. A Harvard University astrophysicist and geophysicist, Willie Soon, said he is “embarrassed and puzzled” by the shallow science in papers that support the proposition that the earth faces a climate crisis caused by global warming.
17. The science of what determines the earth’s temperature is in fact far from settled or understood.
18. Despite activist concerns over CO2 levels, CO2 is a minor greenhouse gas, unlike water vapor which is tied to climate concerns, and which we can’t even pretend to control
19. A petition by scientists trying to tell the world that the political and media portrayal of global warming is false was put forward in the Heidelberg Appeal in 1992. Today, more than 4,000 signatories, including 72 Nobel Prize winners, from 106 countries have signed it.
20. It is claimed the average global temperature increased at a dangerously fast rate in the 20th century, but the recent rate of average global temperature rise has been between 1 and 2 degrees C per century - within natural rates
21. Professor Zbigniew Jaworowski, Chairman of the Scientific Council of the Central Laboratory for Radiological Protection in Warsaw, Poland says the earth’s temperature has more to do with cloud cover and water vapor than CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.
22. There is strong evidence from solar studies which suggests that the Earth’s current temperature stasis will be followed by climatic cooling over the next few decades
23. It is myth that receding glaciers are proof of global warming as glaciers have been receding and growing cyclically for many centuries
24. It is a falsehood that the earth’s poles are warming because that is natural variation and while the western Arctic may be getting somewhat warmer, we also see that the Eastern Arctic and Greenland are getting colder
25. The IPCC claims climate driven “impacts on biodiversity are significant and of key relevance” but those claims are simply not supported by scientific research
26. The IPCC threat of climate change to the world’s species does not make sense as wild species are at least one million years old, which means they have all been through hundreds of climate cycles
27. Research goes strongly against claims that CO2-induced global warming would cause catastrophic disintegration of the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets.
28. Despite activist concerns over CO2 levels, rising CO2 levels are our best hope of raising crop yields to feed an ever-growing population
29. The biggest climate change ever experienced on earth took place around 700 million years ago
30. The slight increase in temperature which has been observed since 1900 is entirely consistent with well-established, long-term natural climate cycles
31. Despite activist concerns over CO2 levels, rising CO2 levels of some so-called “greenhouse gases” may be contributing to higher oxygen levels and global cooling, not warming
32. Accurate satellite, balloon and mountain top observations made over the last three decades have not shown any significant change in the long-term rate of increase in global temperatures
33. Today’s CO2 concentration of around 385 ppm is very low compared to most of the earth’s history - we live in a carbon-deficient atmosphere
34. It is a myth that CO2 is the most common greenhouse gas because greenhouse gases form about 3% of the atmosphere by volume, and CO2 constitutes about 0.037% of the atmosphere
35. It is a myth that computer models verify that CO2 increases will cause significant global warming because computer models can be made to “verify” anything
36. There is no scientific or statistical evidence whatsoever that global warming will cause more storms and other weather extremes
37. One statement deleted from a UN report in 1996 stated that “none of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed climate changes to increases in greenhouse gases”
38. The world “warmed” by 0.07 +/- 0.07 degrees C from 1999 to 2008, not the 0.20 degrees C expected by the IPCC
39. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says “it is likely that future tropical cyclones (typhoons and hurricanes) will become more intense” but there has been no increase in the intensity or frequency of tropical cyclones globally
40. Rising CO2 levels in the atmosphere can be shown not only to have a negligible effect on the Earth’s many ecosystems, but in some cases to be a positive help to many organisms
41. Researchers who compare and contrast climate change impact on civilizations found warm periods are beneficial to mankind and cold periods harmful
42. The Met Office asserts we are in the hottest decade since records began but this is precisely what the world should expect if the climate is cyclical
43. Rising CO2 levels increase plant growth and make plants more resistant to drought and pests
44. The historical increase in the air’s CO2 content has improved human nutrition by raising crop yields during the past 150 years
45. The increase of the air’s CO2 content has probably helped lengthen human lifespans since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution
46. The IPCC alleges that “climate change currently contributes to the global burden of disease and premature deaths” but the evidence shows that higher temperatures and rising CO2 levels has helped global populations (the same UN IPCC who predicted 10,000,000 'climate refugees by 2010').
47. In May of 2004, the Russian Academy of Sciences published a report concluding that the Kyoto Protocol has no scientific grounding at all.
48. The “Climate-gate” scandal pointed to an expensive public campaign of disinformation and the denigration of scientists who opposed the belief that CO2 emissions were causing climate change
49. The head of Britain’s climate change watchdog has predicted households will need to spend up to £15,000 on a full energy efficiency makeover if the Government is to meet its ambitious targets for cutting carbon emissions.
50. Wind power is unlikely to be the answer to our energy needs. The wind power industry argues that there are “no direct subsidies” but it involves a total subsidy of as much as £60 per MWh which falls directly on electricity consumers. This burden will grow in line with attempts to achieve Wind power targets, according to a recent OFGEM report.
51. Wind farms are not an efficient way to produce energy. The British Wind Energy Association (BWEA) accepts a figure of 75 per cent back-up power is required.
52. Global temperatures are below the low end of IPCC predictions not at “at the top end of IPCC estimates”
53. Climate alarmists have raised the concern over acidification of the oceans but Tom Segalstad from Oslo University in Norway, and others, have noted that the composition of ocean water - including CO2, calcium, and water - can act as a buffering agent in the acidification of the oceans.
54. The UN’s IPCC computer models of human-caused global warming predict the emergence of a “hotspot” in the upper troposphere over the tropics. Former researcher in the Australian Department of Climate Change, David Evans, said there is no evidence of such a hotspot
55. The argument that climate change is a of result of global warming caused by human activity is the argument of flat Earthers. 
56. The manner in which US President Barack Obama sidestepped Congress to order emission cuts shows how undemocratic and irrational the entire international decision-making process has become with regards to emission-target setting.
57. William Kininmonth, a former head of the National Climate Centre and a consultant to the World Meteorological Organization, wrote, “the likely extent of global temperature rise from a doubling of CO2 is less than 1°C. Such warming is well within the envelope of variation experienced during the past 10,000 years and insignificant in the context of glacial cycles during the past million years, when Earth has been predominantly very cold and covered by extensive ice sheets.”
58. Canada has shown the world targets derived from the existing Kyoto commitments were always unrealistic and did not work for the country.
59. In the lead up to the Copenhagen summit, David Davis MP said of previous climate summits, at Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and Kyoto in 1997 that many had promised greater cuts, but “neither happened”, but we are continuing along the same lines.
60. The UK ’s environmental policy has a long-term price tag of about £55 billion, before taking into account the impact on its economic growth. 
61. The UN’s panel on climate change warned that Himalayan glaciers could melt to a fifth of current levels by 2035. J. Graham Cogley a professor at Ontario Trent University, claims this inaccurate stating the UN authors got the date from an earlier report wrong by more than 300 years.
62. Under existing Kyoto obligations the EU has attempted to claim success, while actually increasing emissions by 13 per cent, according to Lord Lawson. In addition the EU has pursued this scheme by purchasing “offsets” from countries such as China paying them billions of dollars to destroy atmospheric pollutants, such as CFC-23, which were manufactured purely in order to be destroyed.
63. It is claimed that the average global temperature was relatively unchanging in pre-industrial times but sky-rocketed since 1900, and will increase by several degrees more over the next 100 years according to Penn State University researcher Michael Mann. There is no convincing empirical evidence that past climate was unchanging, nor that 20th century changes in average global temperature were unusual or unnatural.
64. Michael Mann of Penn State University has actually shown that the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age did in fact exist, which contrasts with his earlier work which produced the “hockey stick graph” which showed a constant temperature over the past thousand years or so followed by a recent dramatic upturn.
65. The globe’s current approach to climate change in which major industrialized countries agree to nonsensical targets for their CO2 emissions by a given date, as it has been under the Kyoto system, is very expensive.
66. The “Climate-gate” scandal revealed that a scientific team had emailed one another about using a “trick” for the sake of concealing a “decline” in temperatures when looking at the history of the Earth’s temperature. 
67. Global temperatures have not risen in any statistically-significant sense for 15 years and have actually been falling for nine years. The “Climate-gate” scandal revealed a scientific team had expressed dismay at the fact global warming was contrary to their predictions and admitted their inability to explain it was “a travesty”.
68. The IPCC predicts that a warmer planet will lead to more extreme weather, including drought, flooding, storms, snow, and wildfires. But over the last century, during which the IPCC claims the world experienced more rapid warming than any time in the past two millennia, the world did not experience significantly greater trends in any of these extreme weather events.
69. In explaining the average temperature standstill we are currently experiencing, the Met Office Hadley Centre ran a series of computer climate predictions and found in many of the computer runs there were decade-long standstills but none for 15 years - so it expects global warming to resume swiftly.
70. Richard Lindzen, Professor of Atmospheric Sciences at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote: “The notion of a static, unchanging climate is foreign to the history of the Earth or any other planet with a fluid envelope. Such hysteria (over global warming) simply represents the scientific illiteracy of much of the public, the susceptibility of the public to the substitution of repetition for truth.”
71. Despite the 1997 Kyoto Protocol’s status as the flagship of the fight against climate change it has been a failure.
72. The first phase of the EU’s Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), which ran from 2005 to 2007 was a failure. Huge over-allocation of permits to pollute led to a collapse in the price of carbon from €33 to just €0.20 per tonne meaning the system did not reduce emissions at all. 
73. The EU trading scheme, to manage carbon emissions has completely failed and actually allows European businesses to duck out of making their emissions reductions at home by offsetting, which means paying for cuts to be made overseas instead.
74. To date “cap and trade” carbon markets have done almost nothing to reduce emissions.
75. In the United States , the cap-and-trade is an approach designed to control carbon emissions and will impose huge costs upon American citizens via a carbon tax on all goods and services produced in the United States. The average family of four can expect to pay an additional $1700, or £1,043, more each year. It is predicted that the United States will lose more than 2 million jobs as the result of cap-and-trade schemes. 
76. Dr Roy Spencer, a principal research scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, has indicated that out of the 21 climate models tracked by the IPCC the differences in warming exhibited by those models is mostly the result of different strengths of positive cloud feedback - and that increasing CO2 is insufficient to explain global-average warming in the last 50 to 100 years.
77. Why should politicians devote our scarce resources in a globally competitive world to a false and ill-defined problem, while ignoring the real problems the entire planet faces, such as: poverty, hunger, disease or terrorism.
78. A proper analysis of ice core records from the past 650,000 years demonstrates that temperature increases have come before, and not resulted from, increases in CO2 by hundreds of years.
79. Since the cause of global warming is mostly natural, then there is in actual fact very little we can do about it. (We are still not able to control the sun).
80. A substantial number of the panel of 2,500 climate scientists on the United Nation’s International Panel on Climate Change, which created a statement on scientific unanimity on climate change and man-made global warming, were found to have serious concerns.
81. The UK’s Met Office has been forced this year to re-examine 160 years of temperature data after admitting that public confidence in the science on man-made global warming has been shattered by revelations about the data.
82. Politicians and activists push for renewable energy sources such as wind turbines under the rhetoric of climate change, but it is essentially about money - under the system of Renewable Obligations. Much of the money is paid for by consumers in electricity bills. It amounts to £1 billion a year.
83. The “Climate-gate” scandal revealed that a scientific team had tampered with their own data so as to conceal inconsistencies and errors. 
84. The “Climate-gate” scandal revealed that a scientific team had campaigned for the removal of a learned journal’s editor, solely because he did not share their willingness to debase science for political purposes.
85. Ice-core data clearly show that temperatures change centuries before concentrations of atmospheric CO2 change. Thus, there appears to be little evidence for insisting that changes in concentrations of CO2 are the cause of past temperature and climate change.
86. There are no experimentally verified processes explaining how CO2 concentrations can fall in a few centuries without falling temperatures - in fact it is changing temperatures which cause changes in CO2 concentrations, which is consistent with experiments that show CO2 is the atmospheric gas most readily absorbed by water.
87. The Government’s Renewable Energy Strategy contains a massive increase in electricity generation by wind power costing around £4 billion a year over the next twenty years. The benefits will be only £4 to £5 billion overall (not per annum). So costs will outnumber benefits by a range of between eleven and seventeen times.
88. Whilst CO2 levels have indeed changed for various reasons, human and otherwise, just as they have throughout history, the CO2 content of the atmosphere has increased since the beginning of the industrial revolution, and the growth rate has now been constant for the past 25 years.
89. It is a myth that CO2 is a pollutant, because nitrogen forms 80% of our atmosphere and human beings could not live in 100% nitrogen either: CO2 is no more a pollutant than nitrogen is and CO2 is essential to life.
90. Politicians and climate activists make claims to rising sea levels but certain members in the IPCC chose an area to measure in Hong Kong that is subsiding. They used the record reading of 2.3 mm per year rise of sea level.
91. The accepted global average temperature statistics used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change show that no ground-based warming has occurred since 1998.
92. If one factors in non-greenhouse influences such as El Nino events and large volcanic eruptions, lower atmosphere satellite-based temperature measurements show little, if any, global warming since 1979, a period over which atmospheric CO2 has increased by 55 ppm (17 per cent).
93. US President Barack Obama pledged to cut emissions by 2050 to equal those of 1910 when there were 92 million Americans. In 2050, there will be 420 million Americans, so Obama’s promise means that emissions per head will be approximately what they were in 1875. It simply will not happen.
94. The European Union has already agreed to cut emissions by 20 percent to 2020, compared with 1990 levels, and is willing to increase the target to 30 percent. However, these are unachievable and the EU has already massively failed with its Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), as EU emissions actually rose by 0.8 percent from 2005 to 2006 and are known to be well above the Kyoto goal.
95. Australia has stated it wants to slash greenhouse emissions by up to 25 percent below 2000 levels by 2020, but the pledges were so unpopular that the country’s Senate has voted against the carbon trading Bill, and the Opposition’s Party leader has now been ousted by a climate change skeptic.
96. Canada plans to reduce emissions by 20 percent compared with 2006 levels by 2020, representing approximately a 3 percent cut from 1990 levels but it simultaneously defends its Alberta tar sands emissions and its record as one of the world’s highest per-capita emissions setters.
97. India plans to reduce the ratio of emissions to production by 20-25 percent compared with 2005 levels by 2020, but all Government officials insist that since India has to grow for its development and poverty alleviation, it has to emit, because the economy is driven by carbon.
98. The Leipzig Declaration in 1996, was signed by 110 scientists who said: “We - along with many of our fellow citizens - are apprehensive about the climate treaty conference scheduled for Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997” and “based on all the evidence available to us, we cannot subscribe to the politically inspired world view that envisages climate catastrophes and calls for hasty actions.”
99. A US Oregon Petition Project stated, “We urge the United States government to reject the global warming agreement that was written in Kyoto, Japan in December, 1997, and any other similar proposals. The proposed limits on greenhouse gases would harm the environment, hinder the advance of science and technology, and damage the health and welfare of mankind. There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of CO2, methane, or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth’s atmosphere and disruption of the Earth’s climate.
100. A report by the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change concluded, “We find no support for the IPCC’s claim that climate observations during the twentieth century are either unprecedented or provide evidence of an anthropogenic effect on climate.”

Climate change communism?,"How does communism deal with climate change, and how does climate change affect the path towards proletarian liberation?

The first question I ask because, as far as I have read, Marx and Engels never address climate change. Obviously, the scientific theory was developed far after their time so they never could have. How will we deal with issues like overproduction of greenhouse gasses under communism?

Engels states in The Principles of Communism:

>""Above all, it will have to take the control of industry and of all branches of production out of the hands of mutually competing individuals, and instead institute a system in which all these branches of production are operated by society as a whole – that is, for the common account, according to a common plan, and with the participation of all members of society. ""

Does the common plan account for the environmental effects of production, or is there some other mechanism I'm missing that can address climate change?

Second, I've seen on here climate change argued as something that could potentially speed up the development of class consciousness and the proletarian revolution. Do you all agree with this take, or will climate change harm the development of communism long term? Personally, I'm not sure how to feel about it, but the history of the state has shown that environmental issues turning into economic issues has allowed for revolution in the past, such as the potential revolutions during the Bronze Age or environmental effects that increased the development of the bourgeoisie during the Middle Ages.

"We can't ""just adapt"" to climate change","Preface: Yes, the Earth is rapidly warming and humans are the primary cause - mainly through the burning of fossil fuels. Since 1997 between 97% and 100% of scientific studies on climate change have concluded that humans are the primary cause with a 95%+ certainty and of those that didn't very few of them passed peer review because they had glaring problems with their research methods and out of those that did pass peer review **not a single one** has ever been replicated. And yes, this is going to cause increasing problems in the future and is even beginning to cause problems now. The only way for this not to be true is if tens of thousands of scientists were involved in a major conspiracy stretching decades back.

Virtually every time climate change gets mentioned on this sub a significant number of answers is ""Well we can't do anything now so we just need to adapt!"". That's not to say it's impossible to adapt and we're all gonna die, it means we need to actually take measures to mitigate the warming and delay it as well as prepare for what's to come.

Not mitigating the causes themselves would result in the climate continuing to worsen. Worsening weather conditions with more severe and frequent natural disasters and ecological collapse (which is already happening) would result in the displacement of a conservative estimate of just under 300 million people worldwide, economies that rely on fishing and agriculture would be severely impacted and experience both food shortages and economic turmoil which would in turn prevent them from adequately addressing said food shortages.

Much of this is irreversible, once the ice sheets have melted they will not come back for **at least** thousands of years if not tens of thousands, if a species goes extinct it will never come back and the effects of its removal from the food chain and ecosystem will be drastic.

So can we not just adapt to all of this?

Just adapting and doing nothing to mitigate it or stop it would for starters be insanely expensive. It isn't as simple as just building dams where the sea level rises (dams btw cost a lot to maintain) or just moving all the people who lose their livelihoods or homes. Poorer nations would need resources they don't have in order to cope and even richer nations would experience significant economic impact from the costs. The medical technology to deal with the increased rates of diseases caused and exacerbated by pollution also doesn't exist and likely will not exist for decades - and when it does it may be too expensive to be easily accessible for the general population - so life expectancy will drop and available workforces will shrink.

That's not to mention the things we simply can't adapt to such as the increase in natural disasters, those can never just become a regular part of our lives. Notice how big of a deal the occasional forest fire, hurricane, or flood is in places where it's common; now imagine how bad it'll be when they become even more common and start to occur in places they didn't previously and there doesn't even exist means of dealing with them.

Even if we somehow managed to deal with the impending changes the worsening climate would eventually surpass our adaptation strategies and we would have to go through all of this again. Eventually we would reach a tipping point where we couldn't adapt.

So what do we need to do?

To name a few things:

* We need to create better public transportation and create less of a reliance on personal vehicles, build denser cities that can easily be walked or require shorter daily car trips.
* Create more renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. It's not even that expensive long-term and the primary hindrance has been misinformation and a lack of a will to enact.
* Stop dumping plastics and other waste in the ocean and overfishing, both of which have significant climate and ecological impacts.
* Enact adaptation strategies. Build homes that are more resistant to natural disasters, prepare for population shifts with more homes and jobs, prepare for the potential loss of infrastructure.

And we can't just have these as pet projects or do them ""on the side"" while we continue doing things like we do now. These need to be extensive and we will feel the changes and they need to occur alongside pre-emptive adaptation strategies and preparation.

&#x200B;

And to pre-emptively address the comments we're all tired of seeing:

>But it's cold now so how can the Earth be warming?

When we talk about the Earth warming we're talking about global **average** temperatures. No sane person denies that winter has or will anytime soon stop existing or that it's never cold. The increasing harshness of winters is also caused by a weaker jet stream, caused by climate change, which allows the cold air from the poles to travel further towards the equator.

>But the USSR and East Germany polluted a lot too

During the first decades of industrialization the USSR relied on heavy industry and had less access to alternatives and those were not easily replaced during the later years, East Germany was blocked from the greater energy market and had to rely on brown coal (which is very polluting) as a fuel source. It had nothing to do with socialism just magically polluting more. It was also during a time green energy either didn't really exist, was less accessible, or was still being properly developed - this is not an issue today.

>How can you blame capitalism? Why can't capitalism fix this? The market provides!

Capitalists (as in those who own the means of production, not advocates of capitalism) have repeatedly shown to be an active hindrance to stopping or mitigating climate change. Capitalism has no incentive to actually stop it, the capitalists have spent absurd amounts of resources creating a false narrative of there being some debate over the existence of climate change or the human part in it or promoting solutions that don't work well enough such as afforestation.

Markets don't always provide solutions, if it's cheaper or more convenient to convince people the problem is not significant or less immediate than it is, they'll opt for that instead. Socialism does not have this disincentive.

>But the top polluter in the world is China!

Not per capita, and yes naturally one of the most populated countries in the world emits more pollution than less populated nations. That's obvious.

>Let's go nuclear then

Yes. But just nuclear alone isn't enough. While it's often overlooked, and admittedly often exaggerated, there do exist significant safety concerns and the initial costs of going nuclear are too high to be an immediate solution to the impending problems.

>But there have been other periods of warming in Earth's history before humans

There have been two periods that even compared to today: The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum and the Cretaceous Hot Greenhouse Period. The PETM was caused by inland seas rapidly drying out and releasing methane from the ocean sediments into the atmosphere, which is a potent greenhouse gas. The CHGP's cause is a bit less certain but is widely believed to have been primarily caused by a period of increased volcanic activity - including multiple mega volcanoes going off in a short period.

There having been other periods of warming doesn't mean ours has the same cause or that we can dismiss the human factor out of hand. Those warmings also happened significantly slower and were otherwise wildly dissimilar to our warming trend.

>You're being too pessimistic. We can probably deal with it.

There exists overwhelming scientific evidence that this is a genuinely big deal we can't just ignore and deal with when it happens, and virtually no evidence exists that this is an exaggeration. Even the most optimistic predictions are drastic and will affect hundreds of millions of people negatively. And no, Judith Curry doesn't say it's not a big deal or a hoax and she hates her work being used that way.

>Cow farts lololololol

Yes, cows fart and burp methane which is a potent greenhouse gas and the large cattle areas in Latin America coupled with the deforestation to create grazing areas for them (trees absorb CO2) is a significant contributor to pollution and emission of greenhouse gasses, not the main one but a significant one nonetheless. It's silly but it's true. Beef is a ridiculously inefficient food source.

>But what about global cooling and all the failed predictions? Those were exaggerated and we dealt with those just fine.

Global cooling was mostly media sensationalism that didn't accurately reflect any scientific data or information available at the time. It was speculation that was being looked into due to several factors present in the 1970s and no reliable or serious scientist or institution took the stance that global cooling was an immediate or serious threat.

The predictions that didn't come true, such as the growing hole in the ozone layer or the increased problems caused by acid rain, didn't come true because we were able to deal with them. They were smaller scale problems with mostly singular causes we could address without making drastic changes. The current climate change crisis is a global problem with multiple, large scale causes that require different mitigation strategies and significant international cooperation.

To say those are the same as our current climate crisis is comparing apples and oranges.

>lol a few hundred million people isn't a big deal

It's a huge fucking deal. The Syrian refugee crisis was just under 7 million and had drastic effects both economically and socially all over the Middle East and Europe, Iceland's central banking system collapsing had widespread economic effects which we still haven't fully recovered from, etc. changes in individual countries that don't have a major impact on the global status quo can still have drastic, long lasting effects.

Planting million of trees solve climate change ?,"Planting millions of trees can solve climate change?

Earth is expressing climate change on a scale and pace never seen before. since our species has been on this planet and were causing it by pumping more heat trapping CO2 into the atmosphere than earth natural system can take out
    Solving a problem as massive as climate change is gonna take tone of
solutions. But may be the trees might be the big part of our answer
    Past 370 million years or so they've been the one of the major ways  earth sucks out excess carbon out of the atmosphere and stores it away. This natural technology captures way better and cheaper than any other human technology we've come up with so far. But can trees actually big  enough difference in cleaning up our mess.
    So many Indian states are planting millions of trees to prevent climate change. Recently Uttar Pradesh  planted 250 million trees in a green campaign which is a really good step to take .Planting a million trees has a lot of advantages but scientists say it's not gonna solve climate change on its own. We also have to stop emitting so many greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere.
    Earth forests absorb on average 16 million metric ton of co2 annually. But human activities can turn forests into sources of carbon thanks to deforestation and wildfire, forests also emit 8.1 billion tons of gas back into the atmosphere. That leves net amount of 7.6 billion tons of co2 absorbed annually. Considering that the world emitted 36 billion tons of CO2 in 2019.
  Instead of planting more trees we have to protect the trees which we already have. Trees are basically big carbon machines which sucks carbon out of the atmosphere and turn into more trees. Cutting those trees puts carbon back into the atmosphere.
Most deforestation happens in tropical regions.tropical regions act as air conditioning for the planet. They pull moisture out of the ground, release water into air and create rain and weather patterns across the globe. Cutting those trees can raise nearby temperature by as 3°C so keeping the trees we have  is essential if we want to keep climate change from getting worse.
  Even if we saved every tree that already exists and if we planted trees in every spot on earth we still wouldn't absorb all the climate change greenhouse gasses which we emit every year.
  No matter what climate solution we talk about, whether it's electric cars or something, none of it will work unless we stop putting so much greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. It's really that simple solving climate change isn't just about what we do, it's about what we stop doing",EarthStrike,26,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/EarthStrike/comments/194trgm/planting_million_of_trees_solve_climate_change/

* Invest heavily in nationalized public transportation

Some thoughts on climate change,"The climate is changing, that is extremely obvious to me living here in BC, Canada. Every single year our summer is now forest fire season, with at least 2-3 months having smoke in the skies from various fires around. We are having much more frequent drying up of streams and regular water shortages. This was never the case until the last decade.

There’s no doubt the climate is changing, but I think way too much attention is given to greenhouse gasses. 

Of course, the greenhouse effect will help the self-perpetuating cycle of heating, but why is the climate changing at all?

I posit that a much larger share of our climate change is due to the constant terraforming we do to the planet. 

We cut down forests, which changes the amount of clouds in the sky and the local weather patterns as a consequence. 

We pave over once porous surfaces with concrete, which displaces all the water that would have been absorbed into the ground and thus the local water table. It also changes the density of the soil beneath all the added weight of cities, which further affects the flow of subsurface water. 

We create dams, divert rivers and otherwise directly alter the path of water. This means now the previous path of water which nourished the land and plants becomes dryer, which means less respiration of the vegetation which is less moisture in the air which is less clouds to form and create rain.

We suck billions of litres of water out of the local ground, package it in bottles and ship it around the world. Now that water is being consumed elsewhere, passed through the urine and into a completely different country. All this movement of water around the world is undoubtably creating massive changes in weather patterns.

This is only a tiny fraction of the change we do to the actual surface of the planet, but it never seems to be talked about as a cause for climate change. When people talk about forests being cut down, it’s always “ohhh they’re no longer a carbon sink” or some other way related to the greenhouse effect.

I think it’s highly unlikely that having lower CO2 levels globally, even before industrial age levels would have any meaningful impact on climate change since we don’t even talk about or address all the other direct ways we are affecting local ecosystems which affect the larger local climate which affects the larger global climate.

An analysis of climate change in DotA2: increased pick rates of climate-endangering TI6 meta heroes negatively impacts a vulnerable hero sub-population.,"**TL;DR:** The TI6 meta led to increased pick rates of environmentally harmful heroes, which in turn negatively affected the success of a hero sub-population.

Before I begin, I humbly ask anyone who would be willing to take a few minutes of their time to [please fill out this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScaZc13dWRtvlsSPJalQQuyn_ZI-6mbVDOH9nEttU3rjcob1g/viewform)
for an upcoming analysis. I appreciate your help, thank you very much!

Hello Everyone,

Another International has come and passed, and in its wake has left the typical passion, excitement, and of course, monetary rewards. The typical fan finds themselves caught up in this gaming whirlwind without thinking about many of the secondary effects that ripple from each TI. Hero picks in public games often become influenced by the unique meta that blossomed within the tournament. Granted, while nearly all of the available heroes were picked this TI, there are obvious standouts that were picked most often—this doesn’t go unnoticed by the millions tuning in. When heroes are over-represented in such a high profile public showing, it is expected that those trends may carry-over into public games. This analysis seeks to study some of these trends from TI6, and explore the potential dangers that they may pose to some of DotA2’s most vulnerable heroes.

Climate change has become an increasingly recognizable threat to the planet. Whatever your beliefs are concerning its cause, overwhelming scientific evidence suggests it is happening. However, the lasting effects of climate change are not immediately obvious. While recent data shows the past months/years as being the hottest on record, we only have predictions and models to hypothesize what detrimental changes might take place in the next 50+ years. This includes sea levels rising, water supplies becoming short, air pollution, and the like. To many, the immediate effects of climate change are more opaque, and there are less drastic concerns to point at and say, “Look at this horrible thing!” Sure, we may get [the occasional reminder that snow will melt indoors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E0a_60PMR8), or that somewhere out there in the Arctic there’s a polar bear missing out on the smooth refreshing taste of a Coca-Cola© because of too small, few and far between ice floats, but those aren’t exactly pressing concerns. Regardless, the most notable examples of “now-impacting” climate change are already vulnerable species, or those who are becoming increasingly threatened due to changes in their environment via climate change.

Whether players think about it or not, DotA2 has its own natural environment. A diverse set of living beings inhabit a world filled with extensive forest, flowing water, and unique geological topography. As such, it stands to reason that this ecosystem and its inhabitants could be affected by hero-made climate change. As an example, Treant Protector (a tree who utilizes other trees for survival), might be negatively influenced by heroes causing deforestation such as Engima (midnight pulse). Worrisomely, the aforementioned over-represented meta heroes this International have the potential to negatively impact the climate. **Therefore, I hypothesize that the increase of climate-endangering heroes in public games, as a result of their popularity in TI6, directly leads to negative outcomes for heroes especially vulnerable to these micro environmental fluctuations.**

For the purposes of this study, I chose four (4) meta heroes prominently featured in TI6: Batrider, Shadow Demon, Timbersaw, and Elder Titan. As a result of these heroes’ popularity among drafters, a clearly observable increase in their pick rates is observed during TI6 ([Figure 1](http://imgur.com/a/RkmiY)). These four heroes each contributes to climate change as follows:

**Timbersaw:** Widely considered the principal culprit and chief advocate of deforestation, this chain-saw wielding imp causes the highest rate of tree-loss per hour out of all heroes. As if that wasn’t enough, a constant stream of pollution bellows from his engine in the form of soot-black emissions.

**Batrider:** Instead of slowly trapping heat in the atmosphere via greenhouse gasses, Batrider cuts out the middle-man and simply engulfs the map in flames. His spread of long-lasting fires, not to mention disgusting black tar, leaves irreparable damage in its wake. And while he’s not quite as bad as Timbersaw, this bat rider is no friend to trees either.

**Shadow Demon:** Shadow Demon’s influences on climate change may not be outwardly as obvious as the previous two heroes. While he doesn’t release pollution or set the world on fire, he does contribute to another key area of climate concern; overpopulation. With an ability to directly clone another hero (twice!) Shadow Demon not only effectively triples the hero population, but also increases the size of that population’s eco-footprint three fold ([Figure 2](http://imgur.com/a/smAPX)).

**Elder Titan:** Yeah, like ripping a giant gash in the earth isn’t going to cause problems.

Having outlined the potential climate-harming effects of the above heroes, and having shown their increased pick rates, I then picked four (4) of what I postulated to be the most susceptible heroes to these changes. If we consider warming, then ice heroes (like polar bears) are likely to see more immediate impacts on their overall success due to increased pick rates of climate-detrimental heroes. Therefore, the win-rates of Ancient Apparition, Crystal Maiden, Tusk, and Winter Wyvern were closely examined for changes as a result of TI6-influenced hero trends. The results are presented here in [Figure 3](http://imgur.com/a/HIrEW).

Alarmingly, each ice hero shows a significant drop in winning percentage during the same time period in which the climate-harming TI6 meta heroes saw a bump in pick rates. It was not altogether surprising to see already vulnerable heroes like Tusk, who had an established low win-rate (41%), be further harmed by climate change. What is more shocking, however, is that even an otherwise successful ice hero like Crystal Maiden (55% win rate) saw a dip in her success as well. **These results highlight the very immediate short-term consequences of DotA2 climate change on threatened hero populations.**

While these consequences were partially mitigated in correlation with decreased pick rates of climate-damaging heroes, it is important to consider the possible long term effects of picking heroes who promote climate change. By using advanced statistical algorithms and predictive modeling, I calculated how the win rates of the four ice heroes might look in the next 50 years if environmentally-destructive heroes continued to be pick at high rates ([Figure 4](http://imgur.com/a/wfrrM)). These models present a bleak, stark future; a world in which some of our most treasured and endangered heroes could never win a game of DotA2 again.

In conclusion, these data present the first evidence to date of climate change negatively impacting heroes within the DotA2 environment. Importantly, these negative effects seemed to be a result of environmentally unfriendly heroes being picked at higher rates. This in itself was a result of hero trends that became popularized by the TI6 meta. **The DotA2 public as a whole has a responsibility to reduce their use of climate-harming heroes, while prioritizing more eco-friendly ones. Even more so, the professionals who are so often idolized and emulated must be conscious of their drafts, and be aware the public will follow their lead.** All it takes is one set of polluting heroes to cause harm to our DotA2 world.

Global warming: an imperfect history | Simon Clark repeats some myths about Eunice Foote,"**Introduction**

On 30 November 2022, Youtuber r/SimonClark, made [an excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGtAilkWTtI) on the lengthy history of climate change science. The science is rock solid, but the history less so.

The video made several claims about Eunice Foote, a nineteenth century scientist who made an important observation related to climate change, and in this section Simon made a few missteps, which I'm correcting here. I'll be covering these topics.

1. Were Foote’s patents in her husband’s name?
2. Was Foote’s paper a first for women?
3. Did Foote discover the greenhouse effect?

For a video version of this post with additional detail, go [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WbRP1GFzqw&ab_channel=veritasetcaritas).

**Where Foote's patents in her husband's name?**

Clark provides a good general introduction to Foote’s early life, and then says this.

>She invented a paper-making machine a thermostatically controlled cooking stove and less squeaky shoes and she was a scientist. But of course she was those things in a society in which to be a woman was to be excluded. While she was an inventor her inventions were patented in her husband’s name as women couldn’t defend patents in court.

This isn't true. Foote's squeaky shoe patent was made in her own name, as you can see when you find the patent in the US patent registry; it literally opens with ""Be it known that I, EUNICE. N. FOOTE, of Saratoga Springs, in the county of Saratoga and State of New York, have invented an Improvement in Boots and Shoes"".\[1\] 

In fact Foote’s filing of a patent in her own name was not remotely revolutionary. The first woman in the US to apply for and receive a patent in her own name was Mary Kies, all the way back in 1809, who used a law passed in 1790 which was worded to allow “any person or persons” to file a patent application, without reference to gender.\[2\]

**Was Foote's paper a first form women?**

At around 7:08 Simon makes this statement about the most significant scientific contribution Foote ever made, and the entire reason why she features in his video.

>So when she published circumstances affecting the heat of the sun’s rays in the American Journal of Science and Arts in 1856 it was the first ever publication by a female author in any scientific journal other than those dedicated to astronomy.

This isn't true. Foote’s paper was preceded by at least 30 years by scientist Mary Somerville, a Scot. In 1826, Somerville published a six page paper in the prestigious scientific journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, entitled On the Magnetizing Power of the More Refrangible Solar Rays.\[3\] In it she explained she was testing a hypothesis about magnetism proposed by a professor Mirichini in Rome. This paper was very obviously not about astronomy.

In 1846 Somerville had an 11 page paper published in the same scientific journal, this one entitled On the Action of the Rays of the Spectrum on Vegetable Juices.\[4\] Again, it described in detail her scientific hypothesis and experimental methodology. Again, certainly not about astronomy.

**Did Foote discover the greenhouse effect?**

At around 7:21 Simon makes this statement about Foote’s experiment.

>In her paper she detailed experiments she conducted with different gasses trapped inside glass cylinders and heated by the sun she noted that when she filled a cylinder with carbonic acid gas carbon dioxide. It was heated to a higher temperature by sunlight and crucially retained its heat much longer than those cylinders filled with other gases. She correctly identified Fourier’s heat trapping property of the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide didn’t obscure sunlight, but it absorbed thermal radiation and by being present in the atmosphere even in very modest quantities this increased the average temperature of the Earth.

This is partially true. Simon’s description of Foote’s experiments is accurate, but his description of her conclusions is incorrect. It’s true that carbon dioxide absorbs thermal radiation, that is, infrared radiation, but there’s no evidence Foote knew this herself. That might seem confusing, since she came to the correct conclusion that carbon dioxide could act as an insulating agent trapping heat, but the fact is her experiment was not measuring thermal radiation, and her equipment actually couldn’t; it wasn’t even designed to. 

Instead Foote appears to attribute the heating effect to solar light radiation, making explicit reference to the visible light of the sun, writing "" My investigations have had for their object to determine the different circumstances that affect the thermal action of the rays of light that proceed from the sun"".\[5\]

It’s puzzling that Foote attributed the heating effect she detected to the visible light from the sun, because at the time she was conducting her experiment it was already known that visible light from the sun was not the primary mechanism responsible for the earth’s warming, but rather the sun’s invisible infrared light.

In his foundational work on the physics of global temperature back in the 1820s, Joseph Fourier had explained the theory of how the earth’s temperature could be raised by the atmosphere trapping thermal radiation from the sun, citing an experiment by meteorologist and mountaineer Horace Bénédicte de Saussure.\[6\]

Fourier described how de Saussure’s experiment demonstrated how the atmospheric temperature, heated by absorbing infrared radiation from the sun, in turn heated the surface of the earth. The experiment used a box with glass walls. Note that this is actually referred to as a hotbox, not strictly a greenhouse, but this is the source of the greenhouse metaphor, which was actually attributed by Fourier in a comment made by Arvid Högbom at the end of the nineteenth century.

In his comments on de Saussure’s work, Fourier writes explicitly “the heat of the sun, has properties different from those of heat without light”, differentiating between visible light and invisible thermal radiation. This is a distinction Foote did not make. Fourier then explained that once the sun’s rays entered the hotbox, “Their heat thus communicated ceases to be luminous, and preserves only the properties of non-luminous radiating heat. In this state it cannot pass through the plates of glass covering the vessel”.\[7\] This was an explicit description of how the sun’s thermal radiation is trapped by the earth’s atmosphere.

At around 8:45 Simon says this.

>Foote’s work was mostly lost in a fire at the Smithsonian Institute in 1865. So she was forgotten for most of subsequent history her results were only rediscovered in 2011. So while you may have heard of Tyndall, Foote was actually the first person, despite many obstacles, to discover that CO2 kept the Earth warmer than it otherwise would be.

Firstly, there’s at least some evidence that Foote was not the first person to discover that carbon dioxide kept the earth warmer than it otherwise would be. In fact the relationship of carbon dixode to the earth’s temperature was already a topic of active discussion in her time, which very likely prompted her research. That's covered in [the video version of this post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WbRP1GFzqw&ab_channel=veritasetcaritas).

Secondly, the reason why people remember Tyndall rather than Foote, is that Foote’s experiment did not help scientists understand the physics of climate change. Her experiment was only capable of measuring sunlight, not the longwave infrared which actually causes global warming. Consequently, Ortiz and Jackson write that her experiment “did not measure the natural greenhouse effect of the Earth’s atmosphere by specifically using longwave IR”. Nor does it seem Foote even understood that it was infrared which causes global warming.\[8\]

Likewise, planetary scientist Ralph Lorenz notes that Foote’s work “is not a discovery of the greenhouse effect - if anything it is the opposite (i.e. an antigreenhouse effect, the absorption of sunlight rather than thermal infrared)”.\[9\]

Climate scientist Katherine Hayoe observes “her rudimentary experimental design of simply putting jars out in the sun did not actually allow her to isolate the effects of the infrared (heat) radiation given off by the earth from the higher-wavelength energy given off by the sun”. Consequently, Hayoe comments, “her conclusion, that carbon dioxide traps more heat than the other gases she measured, is more serendipitous than evidential”.\[10\] In other words, it was a lucky inference rather than a conclusion indicated by her experimental results.

Biochemist Roland Jackson concurs, writing “Foote did not give any clear explanation of the greenhouse effect”, observing “She may have unwittingly detected it”, but that “as she made no comment on those results we can only surmise that she didn’t recognise what might be the cause”.\[11\] In contrast, Jackson points out Tyndall deliberately measured the long-wave infrared radiation which he knew was responsible for warming the earth, and which he knew was trapped by the atmosphere. Additionally, Jackson observes Tyndall also “explained the greenhouse effect in terms of the absorption and radiation of heat by gases including carbon dioxide and water vapour in the atmosphere”.

Ortiz and Jackson likewise explain “Foote did not explicitly theorize or investigate what we now call the greenhouse effect”, and add that her experimental data “do not provide a direct measure of the full, natural greenhouse effect”.\[12\] However, they still acknowledge Foote did show carbon dioxide has an insulating property which can increase the earth’s atmospheric temperature.

Nevertheless, they also observe that despite reaching the correct conclusion that water vapor could increase atmospheric temperature, “her mechanistic understanding as to why was incorrect”.\[13\]

CMV: The existence and human involvement of climate change/global warming shouldn’t be a controversial/political issue.,"The existence of climate change shouldn’t be a controversial/political issue because it is a fact. It has been proven by many scientists that climate change is a current issue that the world is facing. Actually, you don’t need to be a scientist to know that it is present. The increase of global temperatures, natural disasters, and the acidity of the oceans are clear signs that this is a problem we need to solve. 

If you don’t agree that global warming/climate change exists, I can link evidence/articles from credible sources that prove this. If you still disagree, then you are clearly closed-minded, stubborn, and ignorant.

I believe whether or not humans have contributed to or is involved with the issue of climate change is what most people find controversial. This shouldn’t be a political issue because, just like with the existence of climate change, this is also a fact. The majority of climate scientists agree that there is a direct correlation between the unnatural rise in global temperatures and the increased levels of greenhouse gasses in our atmosphere with human industrialization. 

I think what is acceptable to be politicized is how we are to approach or the solutions of the issue. It’s understandable to have differing ideas on how to reverse global warming/slow down the rate of climate change. 

I agree that climate change and global warming has been present throughout Earth’s life. There is evidence that global warming have taken effect multiple times before humans. I think the issue isn’t really global warming but the rate at which the globe is warming. There shouldn’t be any doubt of the unnatural rise of global warming due to humans or its existence as a whole.",changemyview,135,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jlhpxs/cmv_the_existence_and_human_involvement_of/
Electric cars will not solve climate change.,"Right, so I see all these new electric cars and I’m actually pretty impressed with them. I wouldn’t buy one now but I would wait until the technology is more developed but that’s not why I’m writing this.

I’m writing this because I see loads of folks claiming that electric cars will solve climate change. Personally, I feel they worsen it. They have to be powered somehow and it’s a pretty good chance the thing that charges that electric car is something that emits more greenhouse gasses in a regular car. Yes, I know there are solar panels, wind turbines, and water turbines. But the whole idea of electric cars being better for the environment then regular cars is only plausible if the thing that charges them is good for the environment also. 

So until then, if I were you I wouldn’t buy and electric car unless you know for sure that the thing that charges them is green also.

I’m interested to hear other peoples opinions as I know this can be controversial.",unpopularopinion,115,74,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/n2t3oq/electric_cars_will_not_solve_climate_change/
"Why land degradation leads to climate change, and droughts","&#x200B;

""Desertification, land degradation and the occurrence of droughts are problems of a global dimension which are primarily of anthropogenic nature. Most of the research into these phenomena takes place through the link with global climate change, which can be summarised as the enhanced emission of greenhouse gasses triggering global and regional climate change, which in turn may provoke droughts, desertification and land degradation.

Recent research, however, demonstrates that impacts resulting from land-use change are more important than the greenhouse effect to explain regional climate change, occurrence of droughts and desertification. The most important mechanism, in this respect, is the feedback of moisture to the atmosphere through evaporation from vegetation which is required to sustain continental rainfall. Land use change, in general, reduces moisture feedback and enhances runoff, resulting in reduction of rainfall, regional climate change, occurrence of droughts, land degradation, and desertification. Particularly in semi-arid continental regions this problem is predominant. In the Sahel the importance of moisture feedback has been clearly demonstrated, but these feedback mechanisms are evident on other continents as well (Eastern Europe, Continental Asia, Southern Africa, South America, USA).

In this light, it is remarkable that in the international research environment so little attention is paid to the analysis and quantification of moisture feedback processes, whereas enormous research efforts are dedicated to global warming and GCM predictions, which will not yield any tangible actions to be taken locally. The problem of desertification, however, having its cause in local anthropogenic influences on the land-atmosphere interaction, can be addressed by local and regional management actions. Therefore it is of paramount importance that the physical processes leading to regional climatic change and desertification can be established scientifically and quantified.

In addition to the research in the physics of moisture recycling, there is an important need for research into the policy implications of the link between land and water use, climate and water resources availability. If the impact of land and water use on rainfall and water resources availability can be quantified, than the full environmental costs and benefits of certain land use practices can be determined. Land use practises that minimise runoff, and hence maximise moisture feedback, do not only prevent erosion and nutrient losses, but they also sustain continental rainfall. The policy implications for socio-economic development are both of a national and international nature, which may influence the water resources negotiations between upstream and downstream countries.

It can be demonstrated that in West Africa land- use change has affected climate in the Sahel region, often within countries, but certainly at a river basin scale. This means that national policy adjustments, awareness raising, physical planning, implementation incentives, research, education, training, extension and strategic planning at national and international (river basin) scales, can have a direct effect on restoration of the climatic and hydrological systems.""

"One of the most impactful quotes from the new video in copypasta form, so you can spam it to the normies next time an article comes out about Trump denying/downplaying climate change","If you want to do your part to stop climate change, there are some lifestyle changes you can make. You can use LED light bulbs. You can drive a hybrid or electric car. You can use public transportation. You can try not to fly very often. You can eat less red meat. 

But the reality is just 100 companies are responsible for 71% of global emissions, and the burden of stopping this can't really be placed on individual consumers. The companies themselves do not care. Left to their own devices, they will only pursue short-term profit. They will ask the government to build them sea walls while continuing to emit greenhouse gasses. Climate change is exactly the kind of problem that capitalism is really ill-equipped to solve. The time frame involved is short enough that scientists can predict total catastrophe in the foreseeable future, but just long enough not to enter into the shareholder-pleasing decision-making of corporations. So unless there's a drastic change in the next couple decades, this is going to be capitalism's Great Chinese Famine moment, only potentially, it'll be much, much worse. 

This is probably the most important issue facing humanity in the 21st century, so we kinda need to fix it by any means necessary, beginning with rapid political change. If that means direct action, it means direct action, for instance organizing, participating in, or supporting a massive general strike. You also should demand that your politicians take a strong stance against climate change and the companies that cause it.

Why I'm Not Very Worried About Climate Change,"When it comes to the finer points regarding the science of climate change, I'm not very well versed in things like CO2 sensitivity or feedback loops.  I'm generally agnostic on what precisely the science says, so  I avoid getting into any of those arguments, one way or the other.

While I remain open to the idea that human activity is having a warming effect on the planet, I'm definitely not very worried about it.  Here's why...

1. There is *a lot* of nuance to this entire debate.

Crops yields and forest growth are both way up because of the increased CO2 in the atmosphere, and this is obviously a good thing.  Climate activists \**may\** still be correct that the negatives outweigh the benefits, but their credibility becomes strained when they insist on focusing on the bad all day, every day.

2. With history as my guide, the Prophets of Doom™ are almost always wrong.

The list of failed doomsday scenarios once promoted by activists are hard for me to ignore.

3. Climate activists often oppose the most proactive solutions in reducing CO2 - e.g. fracking and nuclear power.

While I'm not a scientist, I am an engineer with more than a decade's worth of experience throughout the electrical utilities.  Energy policy is my bread and butter.  I can't help but note that the ""skeptics"" aren't the people who are opposed to the technologies that will be the most aggressive in reducing greenhouse gasses.

The wonderous irony will forever be lost to most, and that is a shame.

4. To the extent that I'm not versed in the science of climate change, I do understand the issue well enough to spot bad data.

For example, RCP 8.5.  This dataset is wildly unrealistic, and even the IPCC admits it.  Nevertheless, scientists continue to use this dataset in their climate models, and they do it for one very simple reason: it gives them the doomsday scenario they want.

5. For both good and ill, the technological revolution we are currently undergoing right now will have a far greater impact on humanity over the next 20 years than the worst climate change scenario will present over the next century.

Chat GPT, by itself, just might prove to be a bigger deal than the changing climate.

"CMV: There is strong evidence for anthropogenic climate change, and left unchecked the consequences will be catastrophic.","So like many, I first heard about climate change through An Inconvenient Truth.  However I didn't really start thinking about climate change until college, where I took what basically amounted to an introductory earth sciences class.  There I became more familiar with the science behind the greenhouse gas cycle, the supporting evidence, and the possible outcomes.  What really stuck with me was our current understanding of Venus, and how its current conditions (hell on Earth) are commonly attributed to a runaway greenhouse effect.  

In my head the fundamental theory makes sense: the more greenhouse gasses in the air, the hotter it gets, which allows additional greenhouse gas sources to evaporate or sublimate into the atmosphere, reinforcing the rate of change.  On earth this is counteracted by organisms that cycle greenhouse gasses out of the atmosphere, and grow in population when the atmosphere becomes more saturated with greenhouse gasses.  Humans are both emitting greenhouse gasses at a rate far higher than pre-human levels, and killing off organisms that would usually recycle these gasses.  Thus, there is a real long-term risk of triggering a runaway greenhouse effect that renders our planet uninhabitable by life as we know it.  

This belief has been reinforced since then with countless articles (both scholarly and discursive).  As a good survey of the field, I would refer skeptics to the [IPCC Fifth Assessment Report](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/), and particularly their [Physical Science Basis](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/) which I think lays out the most comprehensive summary of the field.  If you don't have time to read 1500+ dry and technical pages, their [Summary for Policy Makers](https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf) provides a good 30-page overview.

Over the years I have heard many arguments against anthropogenic climate change, usually seeking to discredit the researchers or assert that a significant body of scientists disagree.  However in general I have found these arguments to be  unconvincing.  I am not surprised that detractors exist, given the concerted effort by oil companies to fund contradictory research (even as they acknowledge internally that climate change is happening).  Similarly, while there are certainly those scientists that would exaggerate or falsify to support their own agendas, I am not convinced that this is happening on a global scale.  

I believe and care about this so strongly that I have become basically a single-issue voter on the topic. However, after a recent thread contained a link to [this article](https://science.house.gov/news/press-releases/former-noaa-scientist-confirms-colleagues-manipulated-climate-records), I have decided that I am at least open to hearing well-made arguments to the contrary.  After all, I am not a climate scientist, and although I care a lot about this it isn't like I've been reading every single book I could find on it.

Ultimately, it would make my year to find out that I'm wrong on this.  I want humanity to last for a very, very long time, and if climate change isn't something we need to worry about, I would be happy to move on to more pressing issues.

**edit:** Okay folks, time for me to sleep.  Thanks for playing, and thanks for helping me realize that although the impact of climate change is great, we're not on the road to becoming Venus.

Climate change advocacy project," Let me preface this by saying the following; this is a school project, and as such I apologize if the topics mentioned here were mentioned previously in this subreddit. Adding on, even though this is merely a school project, I still believe what I will say is relevant, thus I humbly request you all to take this information and advocate for change using it.

Tldr: Climate change is a very big issue, and there are many components we need to think of when discussing climate change. Of these the most important to consider is cost effectiveness, locals having a say in designing/choosing a solution and the longevity of the solution.

A big effect of climate change is the increase of sea levels. As Global Temperatures rise due to higher and higher concentrations of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, such as carbon, ice caps melt thus increasing sea levels and adding to the distress of those living on coastal regions. The melting of specifically the Thwaites glacier In Antarctica can be especially detrimental as it can wreak havoc on the ocean levels. This is mainly because Thwaites is acting as some sort of barrier for the rest of Antarctica, preventing warm water from having contact with it. This makes it so that Antarctica itself isn't melting as rapidly, as the thwaites glacier is taking the brunt of the energy transfer occurring. We know that energy can take the form of heat, and as particles collide with other particles, heat transfers from hotter places to colder places. We also know that water particles move slower than air particles, meaning that ice melts faster in water as water would then have more prolonged contact with ice, resulting in more energy transfer.

There are some geoengineered that were thought up in order to help combat climate change. One of these solutions is to artificially pin ice shelves in place using islands or Berms in order to prevent them from moving away. This would cost upwards of $3 billion and the time it would take to implement is unknown. Rising sea levels, regardless of these geoengineered solutions, will be a major problem. Adding on, if nothing is done, .5-5% of the world's population will be flooded each year after 2100. This will not only be very expensive, but also will displace a lot of people from their current residencies. For example, a 0.5-metre rise in Guangzhou, China, would displace more than 1 million people, and a 2% increase in sea levels would displace over 2 million. This would result in damages reaching $50 trillion a year, which does not consider the inflation that will most likely occur from now to 2100. Finally, as glaciers and ice sheets shrink, we lose our freshwater resources, and without the glaciers and ice sheets reflective behavior, the earth absorbs more heat, speeding up climate change even further.

Currently, there do exist some solutions that address climate change and sliding sea levels in coastal regions. One of these solutions can be seen in Hampton Roads, where the land is currently collapsing and sinking. The solution proposed over here is to purify and replace muddy aquifers with more clear, drinkable water. This would, however, be very expensive, some with some quoting a cost of over $400 million. Adding on, places such as Dar es Salaam have made artificial structures (sea walls) to offset projected sea rise between 1.5 and 3 ft. over the coming century. Even if solutions currently do exist to combat sea level rise in these coastal communities, it is also important to realize the potential drawbacks of such solutions. For example, while sea walls are meant to combat sea level rise and protect coastal properties, they can also cause erosion and hurt shoreline ecosystems.

Taking all of what I've said into consideration, I feel as if there are certain criteria we need to prioritize when talking about and implementing solutions. These include cost effectiveness, locals having a say in the solution and the longevity of a solution. Cost effectiveness is important, as if a solution is uberly expensive, it becomes that much harder to do and implement. All of the solutions we have so far, especially geoengineered solutions, aren't being implemented mainly due to the fact that they cost a lot, and there's no way to procure funds adequate enough to put them in place. Locals having a say is also important as climate change is directly affecting these locals more so than anyone else, and so will any solutions we conjure up to combat sea level rise and climate change. As such, I feel as if they know better than anyone else what's better for themselves and their community. For example, Rising sea levels threaten the Bay of Bengal’s 4.59 million inhabitants, as the fate of the people is directly tied to its land and the way they use it. If sea levels rise, their farms will get submerged, resulting in them being unusable. This causes them to lose their main source of income, and without it they won't be able to procure basic necessities in order to survive. Due to this affecting them directly, the inhabitants of the Bay of Bengals are owed the right to decide what they want to do for their future. Finally, the longevity of a solution is also majorly important, as we don't want a temporary solution, as opposed to a long term one. Temporary solutions would only end up being more expensive in the long run, and as seen with my argument about cost effectiveness, the cheaper a solution is, the better.

"Yes, Climate Change Is Probably Going To Kill You","[https://predicament.substack.com/p/what-most-people-dont-understand](https://predicament.substack.com/p/what-most-people-dont-understand)

A lot of people do not seem to understand the implications of climate change. The majority of people do not deny that climate change is happening (well, at least outside of the United States), and most of them also understand that it’s us causing it through emissions of greenhouse gases and land-use change. But they still don’t understand that they will probably die from it. Here are the most likely ways you could die because of climate change:

* Food shortages
* Lack of fresh water
* Disease
* Mass migration
* Heat stress
* Conflicts from all of the above

We have already left the Holocene, a 12,000-year period providing us with predictable temperatures and rainfall patterns, enabling agriculture, overpopulation and our current out-of-control ecocidal civilization.

Look at this 10,000 year chart of CO₂ concentration:

Now look at this 12 000 year population chart:

Our ability to cultivate crops (grow food) at a global scale and grow our population to this point, was made possible by this stable climate (soon to be gone), fossil fuel energy, relentless resource exploitation, and our illusion of mastery over nature. When we started burning fossil fuels at large scale, our population exploded and so did the CO₂ concentration in the atmosphere, because our current civilization is built on fossil fuels.

The Holocene is now over. We crossed the limits a long time ago and now the reckoning has arrived. There is no going back, not even if you buy an EV and some solar panels. Sorry. We were warned, but we didn’t listen.

The media and scientists often speak of first-order impacts, such as the melting of ice sheets and rising sea levels, rising temperatures leading to heat waves and droughts, increased and stronger natural disasters, and so on. I suppose they don’t want to cause too much panic, or maybe they are just in denial of reality.

Most people hear that and think:

* Sea levels rising by 1-2 meters by 2100? **No problem, I can just move.**
* Temperatures rising by 3°C globally? **No problem, I live in a cold country and if it gets very hot I will turn on the air-conditioning.**
* Another natural disaster? **These things happen. We will rebuild.**
* Loss of biodiversity? **Sad, but who cares, doesn’t impact me. I am above nature and my food comes from the supermarket.**

What they fail to understand, among many things, are the second and third order impacts from climate change disruption. Most people are 100% dependent on governments, society and global supply chains working the way they are today. Food in the supermarket. Gas at the gas station. Water on tap. Electrical grid powering critical infrastructure and households. Well guess what, climate change is about to disrupt all of that.

Sure, many of us will die from the first-order impacts directly, but most of us will die from the second or third-order impacts that will ripple through economies and societies, and it has already started.

# The Science and Magnitude of Climate Change

Looking at the 400,000 year historical chart below, you will recognize that CO₂ concentration, global temperature and sea level have a positive correlation (they rise and fall together), and you can identify a pattern that repeats every 100,000 years or so. You may also notice that CO₂ concentration of 100 ppm has translated to around 5°C temperature change and a significant change in sea level. The causes of these natural patterns are from variations in the orbital eccentricity (100,000 year cycle), axial tilt (41,000 year cycle), and axial precession (26,000 year cycle). You can read more about these cycles [here on NASA’s website](https://science.nasa.gov/science-research/earth-science/milankovitch-orbital-cycles-and-their-role-in-earths-climate/).

# What has been going on in the past two centuries?

Since 1800 atmospheric CO₂ concentration has risen from 280 ppm to 424 ppm, increasing by 144 ppm. Why? Because we have released approximately 1700 gigatons of CO₂ into the atmosphere, 1400 gigatons from fossil fuel combustion and 300 gigatons from deforestation and land-use change.

*But how do we know CO₂ causes temperature rise?!* CO₂ and other GHG’s trap heat in the atmosphere, increasing global temperatures. This is very basic physics. Just have a look below. No debate to be had. Only an idiot would think otherwise.

*But how do we know it’s us?!* Burning one kg of oil (gasoline, diesel, kerosene, it doesn’t matter) releases 3.1 kg of CO₂. You may be thinking, how can 1 kg of something release 3.1 kg of something? It’s because each carbon atom in the fuel combines with two oxygen atoms from the air, increasing the mass. The same applies to coal and natural gas. Burning 1 kg of coal releases 2.6 kg of CO₂. Burning 1 kg of natural gas releases 2.75 kg of CO₂. This is also very basic science.

*But CO₂ is plant food?!* To put the recent rise in CO₂ ppm into perspective: the shift in CO₂ concentration between the last ice age and the Holocene was 100 ppm, and this change, driven by natural processes, happened over a 10,000 year period. This slow pace of change allowed animals, plants, and ecosystems to gradually adapt and migrate. But now, the rise in CO₂ is happening so rapidly, it’s as if an asteroid struck the planet. Forests are dying and burning, species are going extinct. They are not thriving in this climate. Nature doesn’t have the luxury of time to adjust to this kind of change, making it practically impossible for ecosystems and species to survive (including us).

Unfortunately we are not stopping at 424 ppm, CO₂ concentration is increasing faster than ever before. Here is the [keeling curve](https://keelingcurve.ucsd.edu/) since records began:

Here is an 800 000 year chart:

We've clearly moved beyond the natural cycles of CO₂ variation and are now in uncharted territory.

What we have done is absolutely insane.

Even in the [best-case scenarios we’re projected to peak at around 550 ppm](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/meteo469/node/146#:~:text=If%20we%20are%20to%20stabilize,carbon%20per%20year)%20by%202100.). That would lock in a climate shift equivalent to two ice ages, in the opposite direction, at a pace the Earth hasn’t experienced since the [Permian Extinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian%E2%80%93Triassic_extinction_event) event 250 million years ago. The last time we were at 550 ppm is estimated to have been at least 3 to 4 million years ago. Needless to say, the world was a very different place back then.

Most people, including me, do not have a mental image of what this looks like, making it difficult to truly process what it means for life on earth. So let’s imagine the reverse, an ice age, which we an understanding of what it looked like.

Imagine if we knew for a fact that in 75 years from now, in the year 2100, most of Canada, Northern United States, Northern Europe and the British Isles will be covered in a 1 km thick ice sheet. Governments, businesses, and people living in Toronto, New York, Chicago, London, Stockholm, would probably be in full panic mode, planning a move further south, causing real estate values to plummet and economic chaos when major cities are slowly being abandoned. Who am I kidding, most people would probably be denying it or counting on some tech-solution, because that is exactly what is happening today. Green growth!

The good news is that an ice age is not going to happen any time soon. The bad news is that what is going to happen, *and it really is going to happen*, is the opposite of an ice age, and it’s going to be twice as powerful (in the best case scenario) and 100 times faster.

This rapid climate shift is happening on a planet already in trouble from ecological degradation, with most of its natural defenses gone. Original forest cover gone, most species practically at the cusp of extinction, oceans and ecosystems destroyed from chemicals, plastics and pollutants.

But we are probably not stopping at 550 ppm either. There are tipping points that could push us much further.

# The Tipping Points

I hear a lot of talk from climate scientists about “*if we pass this* [*tipping point*](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Space_for_our_climate/What_are_climate_tipping_points) *then this or that*”. I’m not a climate scientist, but it seems rather obvious to me when reading the peer-reviewed scientific papers being published, that a lot of the tipping points have already been triggered and we are unlikely to stop them, at best, we can slow them down.

# Ice Melt and Albedo Effect - Tipping point 1.5–2°C

As temperatures rise (and they are rising 4 times faster in the arctic) the ice melts, and the surface changes from white (ice) to dark (ocean/land). White surfaces reflect 80-90% of solar radiation, and dark surfaces reflect only 10-20%, absorbing more heat. This is an amplifying (positive) feedback loop, and this process started decades ago. More heat, less ice. This means global temperatures will continue to increase even if we were to stop emissions today (we wont).

Melting ice also causes sea-level rise, and sure, it’s a bit further down the road, but even 1-2 meters of global sea level rise will collapse our civilization. Coastal cities will flood, destroying infrastructure and agricultural land, leading to food shortages, civil unrest, economic and political disruption.

We have already locked in 7 meters of sea level rise. When all the ice has melted, the sea level rise will be 70 meters, that’s the maximum when all ice is gone. This will take some time, perhaps a few centuries.

# Boreal Permafrost Melt - Tipping point 1.5–2°C

Boreal permafrost is frozen ground that has stayed frozen for a very long time. The vegetation (dead plants and animals) froze before it could decompose. When it thaws (unfreezes), it will decompose releasing CO₂ and methane.

*How much is stored?* 

Estimates say 1500 gigatons of CO₂ and 400-500 gigatons of methane CH₄. Methane is 30 times more potent as a GHG. This would be an abrupt warming event. Obviously it won’t all be released at once, but scientists believe around 150 gigatons of CO₂ and 50 gigatons of CH4 will be released within this century.

If 50 gigatons of CH₄ were to be released over 100 years it would be equivalent to 1250–1500 Gt of CO₂. So, about the same as we have already released in total since the Industrial Revolution.

We are already [seeing this happening at accelerating rates](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01313-4). This is a ticking time-bomb that could go off at any moment. We simply do not know when.

# Forest Dieback - Carbon Sinks to Carbon Sources - Tipping point 3–4°C

Trees and plants absorb CO₂ from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, converting it to organic matter such as wood and plant matter. Plants and ecosystems sequester roughly 11-12 gigatons of CO₂ per year. Forests have acted as carbon sinks. When a forest dies, burns or is cut, that CO₂ is released back into the atmosphere.

The Amazon currently acts as a carbon sink, sequestering 2 gigatons of CO₂ per year. In total the Amazon holds between 550 - 750 gigatons of CO₂. Due to deforestation, wildfires, increasing global temperatures and changing weather patterns, there is a very high probability that the Amazon shifts from being a carbon sink to a source within two decades. Every 10% that is lost, releases 55 - 75 gigatons of CO₂ – equivalent to 6-8 years of current global emissions.

In addition to the release of more CO₂, adding to global heating, losing our forests would disrupt weather patterns, because they play a [*key role in the global water cycle*](https://amazonaid.org/resources/about-the-amazon/the-hydrological-cycle/). This would have huge impacts on food production and fresh water.

Obviously, it won’t be gone in a day, it’s a process, but [the trend is clear](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/153175/fires-rage-along-brazils-deforestation-frontier) and shows no signs of stopping at the moment.

Stopping deforestation would make a difference and at least buy us some time. What are the main causes of deforestation in the Amazon? 

* 60-80% is for cattle ranching (beef)
* 10-20% in soybean production (used for livestock feed)
* 5-10% is logging

When people say, stop eating beef, you really should stop. It’s in your best interest even if you don’t care about the animals, which you also should. Look at them:

It’s not only the Amazon that is in trouble. All of our tropical rainforests, boreal forests, and temperate forests are experiencing die-off’s and degradation due to heat stress and droughts from climate change, invasive species and fungal infections, and deforestation from logging and agriculture.

# Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) - Tipping point 2–4°C

The [AMOC is a system of ocean currents](https://www.ecoclimax.com/2024/04/oceanic-circulation-at-risk.html) that plays a critical role in regulating the Earth's climate. It's part of the global ""conveyor belt"" that redistributes heat and influences weather patterns worldwide i.e. temperatures and rainfall.

How it works:

* Warm surface water from the tropics flows northward through the Gulf Stream.
* Warm water reaches the Arctic and North Atlantic, it cools, becomes denser, and sinks to the deep ocean.
* The cold, dense water then flows back southward, creating a continuous circulation.

The AMOC keeps Northern Europe and North America warmer than they would otherwise be. It also plays a massive role in monsoons (rainfall) in Africa, India, South East Asia and South America, as well as the temperatures in these regions. It also cools down Antarctica, when it goes, we can expect the melting to increase at the souther pole.

The [AMOC is slowing down](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39810-w) because of melting ice sheets and increased freshwater, which disrupts the balance of salinity and density in the ocean. You see that little blue blob in the North Atlantic?

If the AMOC severely slows down or “collapses”, a possibility within a few decades, the Northern Hemisphere would see abrupt cooling of 5-10°C (paradoxically), sudden 1 meter sea level rise along the US east coast, and there would be large shifts in rainfall patterns across Africa, the Amazon and beyond. It would disrupt modern civilization and food production at a scale few can comprehend. 

If you think that sounds like good news, because it would counteract global heating in some countries, slow down the permafrost thaw and stop the Arctic ice sheets melting, think again. Global warming wouldn’t stop, it would simply be redistributed with even more extreme and unpredictable consequences. Think about the impacts on food production and fresh water, the basis of our existence. A total disaster.

# Coral Reef Bleaching and Ocean Acidification - Tipping point 1.5–2°C

Coral reeds are carbon sinks, just like the Amazon. Losing the coral reefs means decreasing the oceans capacity to absorb CO₂, making ocean acidification and global warming even worse. It’s also about biodiversity and loss of food-webs. Coral reefs cover only 1% of ocean floor but support 25% of marine species. Many marine species rely on reefs for habitat and food. Losing the coral reefs would lead to many extinctions and disrupt entire ocean ecosystems, that we depend on. Again, expect food shortages.

The coral reefs are [already bleaching and dying](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/worlds-corals-are-bleaching-heres-why-and-what-it-means-oceans-future). Globally we have lost 50% of coral reefs since 1950. If current trends continue, most coral reefs will be functionally lost by 2050.

# What About The Green Transition?

So the plan is to electrify our cargo ships, airplanes, cars, semi-trucks, tractors, excavators, bulldozers and so on. At the same time we will create the materials needed for continuing our way of life; steel, aluminium, concrete, cement, plastics, glass, copper, rubber, and textiles, without using fossil fuels – since we are phasing them out, right?

First of all, let’s consider if we even have enough materials to build out this green transition. Dr. Simon Michaux at the [Geological Survey of Finland](https://www.gtk.fi/en/research/time-to-wake-up/) has done some research on this crucial question. Let me just cut to the chase: we do not have enough materials even if we had all the time in the world to do this transition. But we don’t have any time left. And building out this green transition would require vast amounts of fossil fuels for mining, manufacturing and transportation, tipping us over 2°C either way. This is what we are doing now.

Secondly, let’s consider what is needed to manufacture most of our materials used for products and infrastructure. Most vehicles (cars, trucks, ships, airplanes) and machines require steel.

* How is steel made? With coal \**steel from melt scrap can be done with electric ace furnaces, but this is small scale and requires complete system change*. Almost every product requires plastics.
* How is plastic made? Petroleum \**30% of plastic today is* *from recycled materials, can it scale?*
* How are our roads made? Asphalt (petroleum) or concrete (cement - oil and coal).

These are just some parts of the economy, but you probably get the point. Electrifying transportation is not enough. We are not going to save the planet by electrifying some parts of the economy. Even the most basic products have some input from fossil fuels.

Thirdly, how do we transport all of these materials and products around the world?

* Cargo ships use bunker fuel (oil).
* Airplanes use jet fuel (oil).
* Trucks use diesel (oil).
* Tractors use diesel (oil).
* Mining involves many different vehicles such as dump trucks, excavators, bulldozers, haul trucks, and they use diesel.

And how is this transition going? It’s 2025 soon, have you seen any electric semi-trucks on the road? I haven’t. I see an endless amount of diesel trucks transporting stuff around. I see [governments expanding airports with new runways](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jul/24/heathrow-prepares-third-runway-blueprint-for-labour-amid-record-passenger-numbers). What. the. fuck. I have also not seen any electric cargo ships or airplanes. Have you? How long does an EV battery last? Maybe 10-20 years. Then what?

What I have seen is record amounts of fossil fuels being burned, [we have data on this](https://www.statista.com/statistics/276629/global-co2-emissions/).

*But we have the technology to do this*!? We may have some of the technology. We do not have the materials and we certainly do not have the time. We are already at 1.5°C and will be at 2°C soon enough, nothing is going to stop that.

Finally look at politics today. Does it seem like there is a will to do the above? Denial and right-wing politics are on the rise. Trump just got re-elected, unfortunately it wasn’t rigged, this really is what the people want.

# What are some second-order and third impacts?

As mentioned at the beginning of the article: food shortages, lack of fresh water, disease, heat stress, mass migration and conflicts.

Just in terms of natural disasters, think about the recent storm in Valencia. It wiped out crops, farms, and infrastructure. Homes and livelihoods destroyed. Where are they going to go? Can they afford to rebuild their homes and replace everything that they lost? Did they have insurance? Do they even have a job now, or was their workplace wiped out as well? Worked in the tourism industry? Good luck. All of that equipment would need to be replaced, and the land restored, if they plan to grow food in the region at the same scale, and a lot of people depend on that food.

And this is just the beginning of climate disruption. Rebuild Valencia? What do you do when this happens every year because temperatures are going to increase and storms will keep getting worse, much worse. That’s where we are headed.

When Hurricane Helene ripped across the southeastern US, it caused flooding and damage to infrastructure in areas that are not used to it. In Western North Carolina the destruction was massive to homes, infrastructure, and farms. Many people lost everything, including their homes and jobs, and didn’t have insurance.

Where are they going to go? With what money? They spent days without power, cell phone service, and running water. Imagine not being able to flush your toilet for weeks, or months. That’s the kind of weird shit (pun-intended) you could be dealing with in the future. No power means no refrigeration, your food will spoil, that is, if you can get your hands on any food because the supermarket has already been raided, if you can even get there with the roads being blocked or flooded.

Imagine there’s no FEMA or government coming to rescue you because they are overwhelmed by the amount of disasters and do not have the resources to rebuild and save everyone. Or your government has already partially collapsed and is being run by fools.

The insurance industry is already pulling out from many high risk regions, such as Florida and California. No insurance means you can’t get a mortgage on the house, which means it’s more difficult to sell, which means the value goes down, and if it gets wiped out in a storm, that’s it. You lost your home and you are left with nothing. Imagine a country with 30% unemployment. With 50% unemployment. Or maybe 50% homelessness. How does that not fall apart?

These are just a few examples, and how you need to start thinking about climate change.

There are an endless amount of second and third order impacts from climate change alone that it’s impossible to list and discuss them all. The economy will collapse in one way or another (read my article on [the end of growth](https://predicament.substack.com/p/end-of-growth-and-collapse)) and you could see your savings wiped out quite suddenly.

Climate migration, resource conflicts, political instability, health system strains, civil unrest, hyperinflation, food and water shortages. These are all coming, sooner than you think.

Climate change is one symptom of a much larger problem that some call [*overshoot*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_overshoot), a combination of overpopulation and overconsumption. There is no easy way out. It’s a predicament.

A lot of people do not seem to understand the implications of climate change. The majority of people do not deny that climate change is happening (well, at least outside of the United States), and most of them also understand that it’s us causing it through emissions of greenhouse gases and land-use change. But they still don’t understand that they will probably die from it. Here are the most likely ways you could die because of climate change

"Role of Greenhouse Gases in Climate Change - ""The Concept Of A ‘Greenhouse Gas’ or a ‘Greenhouse Effect’ Has Not Been Demonstrated And Is Thus Without Merit.""","[Role of greenhouse gases in climate change, M. Hertzberg, Alan Siddons, H. Schreuder](https://principia-scientific.org/publications/Role_of_GHE-EaE.pdf)

#Abstract

This study examines the concept of ‘greenhouse gases’ and various definitions of the phenomenon known as the ‘Atmospheric Radiative Greenhouse Effect’. The six most quoted descriptions are as follows: (a) radiation trapped between the Earth’s surface and its atmosphere; (b) the insulating blanket of the atmosphere that keeps the Earth warm; (c) back radiation from the atmosphere to the Earth’s surface; (d) Infra Red absorbing gases that hinder radiative cooling and keep the surface warmer than it would otherwise be – known as ‘otherwise radiation’; (e) differences between actual surface temperatures of the Earth (as also observed on Venus) and those based on calculations; (f) any gas that absorbs infrared radiation emitted from the Earth’s surface towards free space. It is shown that none of the above descriptions can withstand the rigours of scientific scrutiny when the fundamental laws of physics and thermodynamics are applied to them.

#Epilogue

Joseph Priestley, Unitarian Minister and Scientist in whose name the American Chemical
Society’s highest award is given, identiﬁed CO₂ and other gases which he named ‘airs’. He called CO₂, which he collected from breweries, ‘ﬁxed air’ and oxygen ‘dephlogisticated air’. He, along with most 18th Century scientists, were adherents of the phlogiston theory, which posited that combustion involved the loss of a substance they called ‘phlogiston’.

Antoine de Lavoisier, considered the father of modern Chemistry, conducted many out-
standing experiments using the most sophisticated apparatus available at the time and
demonstrated that combustion was a chemical reaction of a substance with oxygen and
phlogiston became apocryphal.

At a time when the laws of thermodynamics had not yet been established, he coined the
term ‘caloric’ to explain the heat generated by combustion and that also in time became
discarded alongside phlogiston. Both these scientists stored and used many labelled ﬂasks and containers of gases, liquids and solids, but none were found labelled ‘phlogiston’ or ‘caloric’.

In one of science’s ﬁrst ‘thought experiments’ Pierre Prevost (1751–1839) conjectured that a hot body absorbed less radiation from a cold body than the reverse, and that both would eventually reach the same temperature. Thus, the theory of radiant exchanges came into being, a view that predated the more thorough understanding of the Laws of
Thermodynamics that came later. **Yet it is noted that aspects of Prevost’s 200-year-old
theory continue to be applied in regard to ‘net ﬂow’ of heat – a concept that radiation
ﬂows both downhill and uphill. The latter ﬂow is a violation of the Second Law, which
informs us that a hot body can absorb no radiation from a cold body to make it warmer
still**. 19

Radiative greenhouse supporters have theorized a blackbody as an all-absorbing entity,
capable of absorbing and retaining its own radiation to elevate its temperature and have
used radiant exchanges in support of their arguments.

In the absence of deﬁnitive experiments to demonstrate the reality of the ‘greenhouse
effect’, and in view of the failure of the previously enumerated deﬁnitions, the effect should join ‘phlogiston’ and ‘caloric’ in Science’s Gallery of ancient constructs.

An added difﬁculty is that so far no way has been found to be able to readily transpose or correlate experiments conducted in the contained, static, isothermal and isobaric conditions of a laboratory to the great vastness of earth’s atmosphere

#Conclusion

The various stated deﬁnitions of the greenhouse effect have been subjected to the rigorous scrutiny and application of the fundamental laws of physics and thermodynamics. They were found to be unreal, and unless some new deﬁnition can be put forward that satisﬁes and complies with those laws, it can only be concluded that the concept of a ‘greenhouse gas’ or a ‘greenhouse effect’ has not been demonstrated and is thus without merit.",climateskeptics,26,113,https://www.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics/comments/15xelez/role_of_greenhouse_gases_in_climate_change_the/
Hemp and Climate Change,"Hemp is believed to be the oldest agricultural crop in history. Evidence and historical documentation of its uses abounds in multiple countries, over many thousands of years. While related to cannabis, the hemp plant contains less than 0.3% THC, meaning it has no psychoactive properties. In the past, it has even been mandatory to grow hemp across Europe for medicines, food, rope, paper, textiles, animal feed, and lamp fuel. In England, hemp was an essential part of the economy, to the extent that in 1533, [King Henry VIII decreed](https://thcmuseum.org/the-history/) that all landholders set aside part of their farmed land for hemp to satisfy the increased demand for rope and sailcloth for his new navy. Every ship that went out to discover new colonies carried hemp seed, and it was the first crop that they laid down. Today, the world is far removed from these historical practices. The creation of hemp-alternatives for things like building, packaging, and paper have a common shared trait of being highly pollutant compared to hemp. The re-emergence of hemp as a possible means to save the planet makes sense when looking at its historical use and future potential.

The unfortunate downfall of cannabis in the eyes of legislators across the world in the past century, such as the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937, effectively dragged hemp down along with it. [Many industries benefitted ](https://books.google.ca/books?id=w0qvkVGO0sgC&pg=PA139&lpg=PA139&dq=henry+ford+The+Billion+Dollar+Crop&source=bl&ots=DqYe0IEOKB&sig=ACfU3U1HHcZAxV7xkBcA-UDrzQFAWT60Ow&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjs09Gkgpn0AhWGDjQIHQB2C_MQ6AF6BAgeEAM#v=onepage&q=henry%20)from this new law by taking the place of hemp and revealing new and alternative products. The pharmaceutical industry benefited by creating and patenting synthetic compounds to replace over 2000 cannabis based medicines previously available. The oil industry benefited as hemp was no longer an alternative option in the fuel and plastics industries. Previously, many plastic products were made from hemp cellulose, such as cellophane. In the early 1930’s, Henry Ford came out with a Model-T car that was made in part from a hemp bio-composite. The car was light, was 10 times stronger than steel, and Henry Ford himself demonstrated that it couldn’t even be dented with an axe during an infamous promotional photoshoot. The car ran on hemp ethanol fuel which was derived from the stalk of hemp. Ford wrote an article about his invention and the vast potential for hemp which was published in Popular Mechanics called “[The Billion Dollar Crop](https://books.google.ca/books?id=w0qvkVGO0sgC&pg=PA139&lpg=PA139&dq=henry+ford+The+Billion+Dollar+Crop&source=bl&ots=DqYe0IEOKB&sig=ACfU3U1HHcZAxV7xkBcA-UDrzQFAWT60Ow&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjs09Gkgpn0AhWGDjQIHQB2C_MQ6AF6BAgeEAM#v=onepage&q=henry%20)”. Today, 46% of oil is used for fuel and 54% in manufacturing products like plastics, rubber, cosmetics and construction materials.

In 1939, DuPont revealed its newest creation, [Nylon](https://www.ptonline.com/blog/post/dupont-celebrates-80th-anniversary-of-nylon), a synthetic fabric made from plastic, and the cotton industry was booming. Previously, hemp cloth had been a dominant competitor in the fabric and textiles industries. Until the late 1800’s, 90% of paper was made from hemp. Today, approximately 15 billion trees are cut down per year, which is faster than new trees are able to grow. The US alone uses approximately [68 million trees per year](https://www.rd.com/list/facts-to-make-you-use-less-paper/) just for paper, and with the current trajectory, society will run out of trees in about 60 years. A return to the use of hemp for paper and other products can help modern society reduce the reliance on trees. Many people see hemp’s illegal status as an unfortunate byproduct of its relation to cannabis, but the hemp industry was also the main monopoly working against massive corporations fighting for dominance in multiple sectors.

The re-emergence of hemp has the potential to help  address some of the biggest challenges in the climate crisis. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the most common greenhouse gases driving climate change. Fossil fuels, livestock, and many industrial processes emit carbon dioxide. Planting trees is one of the most popular ways to offset carbon emissions since plants absorb CO2. Hemp, however, is much more efficient at absorbing carbon than trees. It can take decades for newly planted trees to reach maturity, but hemp can grow as much as 13 feet in 100 days and in ideal climates can yield as many as two or three crops per season. The potential land used for sequestering carbon can be increased dramatically due to hemp’s ability to grow virtually anywhere, and because of its fast-growing nature, it can be utilized to reduce our reliance on non-renewable resources and everyday products, such as trees for paper, or oil for plastics.

The current agricultural system of growing monocrops, massive swaths of one crop such as corn, wheat or soybeans has led to the need for chemicals and pesticides to successfully cultivate the plants. [Over-tilling the soil and a lack of plant variety leads to soil erosion](https://hsuoracle.com/12196/features/beyond-the-delph/entire-species-of-food-crops-are-being-lost-forever/), where the soil loses nutrients and organic matter over time. In 2014 Scientific American published an [article](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/only-60-years-of-farming-left-if-soil-degradation-continues/) about the state of the farming industry, warning that at the current rates of soil degradation, about 60 years of farming remain possible. If one was to grow large fields of hemp crops, what is created is called a carbon sink, drawing carbon out of the atmosphere and putting it back into the soil where it is needed. Hemp offers the opportunity for regenerative agriculture by using it as a rotational crop, where hemp’s natural abilities to enrich the soil it grows in can save the plot of land from too much erosion, while at the same time creating fast-growing and renewable materials for environmentally friendlier products, construction materials and even batteries.

Carbonated hemp can produce an alternative to graphene, which has been touted as an alternative to lithium-ion batteries. Graphene is prohibitively expensive to mine and finite in nature. To produce a gram of graphene costs approximately $2,000, with the hemp alternative, a ton can be produced for $500, making it 4million times cheaper. The waste fibers from hemp crops are “[cooked](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nn400731g)” into carbon nanosheets and built into supercapacitors “on a par with or better than graphene” – the industry gold standard. The transportation industry has begun re-introducing hemp bio-composite into its manufacturing processes, even seen in high-end sports cars such as the [Lotus Elise](https://newatlas.com/lotus-takes-a-holistic-environmental-approach-with-hemp-based-eco-elise/9625/). Further, hemp seed oil produces bio-diesel for fuel, and hemp ethanol which is derived from the cellulose in the stalk. This provides us with the opportunity to adapt already existing cars to run on renewable fuels as opposed to the complete replacement of all cars with electric vehicles, producing massive amounts of carbon in their manufacturing. Furthermore, emissions from bio-diesel and hemp ethanol amount to only 10% of what petrol or diesel produces.

Petrochemical plastics can be replaced with bio-plastics made from hemp. Hemp seeds for human consumption provide us with the safest, most digestible, balanced, natural and complete source of protein, amino acids and essential fats found anywhere in nature. 1 acre of hemp can produce 300 gallons of oil and 3 tons of protein powder. The technology and knowledge is present and available, but on a worldwide scale, a lot more hemp is needed in order to take advantage of the possibilities to reduce waste and negative environmental impacts on an industrial scale.

As it has been known and appreciated historically, the hemp plant is very versatile and has many unique and effective uses. Although humans have known this for a longtime, it is now resurfacing after a long period of prohibition, to be appreciated as a resourceful and effective solution to modern problems.

Episode 5:  Climate Change - Summary and Discussion,"It feels like we’ve given up on climate change, like all the hot air has been sucked out of the bubbling campaigns and released into the atmosphere. Our attention has been elsewhere, forever fragmented by the many competing issues we face.

Meaningfully addressing climate change is going to be very difficult, despite what some might say. We have baked consumption and economic growth into our societies, requiring ever more greenhouse gas emissions. And yet, before people are truly terrified of the consequences, our actions to mitigate climate change will be too little.  Once people are truly terrified it will already be too late.

All this is while it will be the poorest, who have the smallest impact on the climate and who are less able to mitigate against the effects of climate change, who will face its unliveable consequences.

Investment Opportunity to Combat Climate Change!!,"Hello, I hope you're doing well.  
  
I would like to present a business opportunity to you, as well as an opportunity to save lives.  
  
Climate change is happening in front of our eyes, and global warming is rising because of human actions. We are producing 39 billion tons of CO2 every year, and the total extra CO2 present in the atmosphere is around 1021 billion tons. This has raised the concentration from 218 ppm to 427 ppm by 2024. This is causing everything from rising temperatures to ocean acidification, sea-level rise, ice melting, wildfires, and heatwaves.  
  
Over the past several years, I have been studying climate change in depth, understanding its physics, mathematics, economic impact, societal effects, and much more. The solutions given to us are not scalable and are expensive. The best one, direct air capture, still costs $800 per ton, and it is slow. In a year, it will hardly be able to remove thousands of tons, while there is a mountain of 720 billion tons. So, that is literally impossible. Other carbon capture technologies like direct air capture, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), ocean fertilization, afforestation and reforestation, carbon capture and utilization (CCU), enhanced weathering, biochar, and others are not efficient enough to stop this disaster.

Investment Opportunity to Combat Climate Change,"Hello, I hope you're doing well. 



I would like to present a business opportunity to you, as well as an opportunity to save lives.



Climate change is happening in front of our eyes, and global warming is rising because of human actions. We are producing 39 billion tons of CO2 every year, and the total extra CO2 present in the atmosphere is around 1021 billion tons. This has raised the concentration from 218 ppm to 427 ppm by 2024. This is causing everything from rising temperatures to ocean acidification, sea-level rise, ice melting, wildfires, and heatwaves.



Over the past several years, I have been studying climate change in depth, understanding its physics, mathematics, economic impact, societal effects, and much more. The solutions given to us are not scalable and are expensive. The best one, direct air capture, still costs $800 per ton, and it is slow. In a year, it will hardly be able to remove thousands of tons, while there is a mountain of 720 billion tons. So, that is literally impossible. Other carbon capture technologies like direct air capture, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), ocean fertilization, afforestation and reforestation, carbon capture and utilization (CCU), enhanced weathering, biochar, and others are not efficient enough to stop this disaster. We need something that is fast, cost-effective, and scalable.

"Scientific basis linking climate change to ""more extreme weather""","Hey everyone!

I understand the obvious link between increased CO2 emissions & global warming (greenhouse effect).  However, I've seen news articles linking climate change to a bunch of other weather patterns -- everything from hurricanes to extreme cold to droughts & fires.  I don't quite follow the direct link and was wondering if someone can provide more data / science behind this.

My gut feeling would be:

1. The average temperature is getting warmer (and may cascade due to polar ice melt)
2. This is causing weather changes & rise in sea level which could affect coastal communities
3. Some win and some lose, some places see additional rain, and others see additional drought, others may see more mild winters & a longer growing season, which could be good or bad, just different.
4. Hurricanes/storms/events may be more prevalent in some places, and less prevalent in others, due to these changes
5. But are there really ""more hurricanes"" on ""stronger storms"" or ""more polar vortex cold spells"" in aggregate, e.g. compared to historical patterns from the early 1900s?

  
Not being political, just curious and want to better understand these claims.

Thanks!",climatechange,96,112,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1hwm9wq/scientific_basis_linking_climate_change_to_more/
How much climate change is Earth's heat retention vs. the heat output that humans contribute?,"A lot of the things commonly thought to be bad for the climate are actually generally producing a lot of heat - ICE cars, heavy industry, combustion heating systems and so on. Is there any information out there about more detailed causes of global warming? Is human-made greenhouse gas output the definitive key factor?

I keep thinking about how we pump heat out of our homes during summer and inevitably radiate it from our settlements in winter. We use all kinds of devices from smartphones to gargantuan data centers that all shed waste heat. All 8 billion of us produce heat as part of being alive. The majority that uses animal products creates incentive for farming animals that also produce heat. I've always been curious whether our fixation on the greenhouse aspect is actually spot on with our struggle to contain humanity's adverse effects on climate.",climatechange,10,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/1ht2gsb/how_much_climate_change_is_earths_heat_retention/
France went from 55% to 10% reliance on Fossil Fuels in a 10 year period between 1978 to 1988. Nuclear was the reason! And this was long before Climate change was a major concern!,"Nuclear is the answer to Climate change. 

https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/1233715610477105152?s=19

Edit: A lot of the comments suggested that Nuclear is an answer to Climate change. But with the current urgency, nuclear is the most immediate answer to solving the issue in short term with proven results meanwhile we let other technologies mature more to eventually transition to thorium molten salt, Traveling wave and modular reactors along with working on better carbon capture and improved battery technology.

Also even though Greenhouse effect was talked about back in the day, it wasn't considered an existential threat as it is right now and you didn't have governments and countries working extensively to invest in technologies trying to combat it in proportions they are now.

Taylor Swift's usage is bad for climate change - from a perspective of a climate scientist,"Hi everyone, I'm a computational climate scientist! A lot of my work involves modeling warming on a global scale, and I've been doing this work for the past few years. I'll try to keep this brief. 

A big counter argument I see to Taylor Swift's plane usage is that airplanes only cause 2.5% of Co2 emissions. I wanted to break down why looking at that number alone is misleading. 

Co2 is not the only greenhouse gas (GHG) that is emitted from planes. Planes emit nitrous oxides(NOx), sulfur dioxide(SO2), and water vapor which are all GHG that warm the planet: [https://www.transportenvironment.org/challenges/planes/airplane-pollution/non-co2-effects/](https://www.transportenvironment.org/challenges/planes/airplane-pollution/non-co2-effects/)

And the altitude they are released at causes a lot of problems. NOX released at that high altitude catalytically destroys the ozone layer in the stratosphere and troposphere. : [https://archive.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/sres/aviation/index.php?idp=23](https://archive.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/sres/aviation/index.php?idp=23) 

Water vapor also has a similar effect by breaking down and releasing hydrogen oxide in the stratosphere

Another issue is(and in my opinion underrated) is the formation of contrails. Contrails act as fast acting high altitude clouds that can directly affect earth's energy budget.: [https://phys.org/news/2022-12-airlines-contrails-environmental-problem.html](https://phys.org/news/2022-12-airlines-contrails-environmental-problem.html). 

Through radiative forcing, contrails trap heat within the atmosphere and warm the earth. Although they're fast acting, contrails can turn into cirrus clouds which is bad: [https://www.offsetguide.org/understanding-carbon-offsets/air-travel-climate/climate-impacts-from-aviation/contrails-and-cirrus-clouds-from-aviation/](https://www.offsetguide.org/understanding-carbon-offsets/air-travel-climate/climate-impacts-from-aviation/contrails-and-cirrus-clouds-from-aviation/)

Cirrus clouds can exist for a long time and also have the same warming effects as contrails. There's also a lot of other ""minor"" issues with airplanes such as airport deicing that can have an effect on the climate. All these secondary and tertiary effects added together can have 3x as worse of an impact on the climate than if it was just Co2 alone, and looking at Co2 really understates the problem. 

Looking at who is contributing to the problem, it's very weighted to rich people. 1% of the population creates 50% of aircraft emissions while billions of people never have flown once: [https://www.transportenvironment.org/discover/1-super-emitters-responsible-over-50-aviation-emissions/](https://www.transportenvironment.org/discover/1-super-emitters-responsible-over-50-aviation-emissions/)

.0008% of the world owns a private jet, and yet contribute to 8% of total carbon emissions for aviation. That means .0008% of the world is causing .2% of carbon emissions for the entire world. And that's not including all the other effects I described above(I still need to find the raw data on that). TS released 8293 tones of Co2 in one year as the number one private jet user: [https://time.com/6208632/celebrities-climate-impact-private-jets-yachts/](https://time.com/6208632/celebrities-climate-impact-private-jets-yachts/)

That's an absolutely absurd amount for one person, and I think is the whole crux of the issue. Climate change is a problem driven by people who are rich and privileged and is going to affect the people who are the least privileged the most. The people who will have to live with these difficult conditions are the ones who contributed least to the problem. While climate change needs to be fixed through an overall societal change, societal change can only happen with individual change. 

Anyway I hope you all enjoyed my little spiel! I just wanted to end with the fact that I don't think climate change is a hopeless battle. I think we can make progress, and there's still something to fight for, but it requires cutting GHG wherever we can.

##Illegal flaring

**Texas fossil fuel companies are illegally flaring, or igniting, natural gas more often than realized, resulting in unregulated contributions to climate change.**

* Flaring is the burning of “waste” gas in oil and gas operations, sometimes done because the pipeline lacks capacity or as part of routine emission controls. Most of the raw gas is a mixture of hydrocarbons like methane, which is  80 times more potent than carbon dioxide and one of the largest factors in our increasingly warming atmosphere. 

* Even going by the official numbers, which a new report reveals to be inaccurate, Texas has [flared](https://today.tamu.edu/2020/08/03/the-problem-with-natural-gas-flaring/) about as much gas annually as all of its residential users consume. 

* The new report, by [Earthworks](https://www.earthworks.org/publications/flaring-in-texas-a-comprehensive-government-failure/), reveals that more than two-thirds of the 227 flares observed during three months in 2020 were not permitted by the state. “[The regulatory agencies] don’t know about the majority of flaring that goes on in Texas,” [said](https://grist.org/accountability/flaring-methane-texas-shell-exxon-oil-natural-gas/) Alan Septoff, a spokesperson for the nonprofit. “All of the state data that they’re basing their policy decisions on is bunk.”

##Line 3

**Minnesota’s Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal by opponents of a nearly completed oil pipeline through the state called Line 3.**

* Line 3 is a 1,031-mile pipeline owned by Canadian company Enbridge, transporting tar sands oil from Alberta to Wisconsin. Enbridge was forced to reduce the amount of oil transported daily due to numerous cracks and holes developed in the pipeline over time. Consequently, the company proposed and gained approval to build a replacement pipeline ([map](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52abb9b9e4b0cb06a591754d/1559590859074-G46AV0QYH5UQID6S9QS9/line-3-replacement-map.png?format=1000w)). 

* Indigenous communities and environmental groups challenged the construction of the new line in Minnesota, arguing it violates numerous treaties and endangers critical water sources. For instance, Ojibwe tribal members retain certain property rights on land used in the expansion but did not consent to its construction. The new pipeline crosses over 200 bodies of water, including the headwaters of the Mississippi River. An oil spill is not unlikely; in fact, the largest inland spill in U.S. history [occurred](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2021/03/03/30-years-ago-grand-rapids-oil-spill) on the existing Line 3 in 1991.

* The Biden administration has the ability to suspend the permits required to finish construction of Line 3, but has so far failed to do so despite [pressure](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/biden-administration-line-3-pipeline-permits-democrats_n_611c211ce4b0c69681025bc6) from Democratic lawmakers and activists.

##Alaska oil drilling

**District of Alaska Judge Sharon Gleason (Obama appointee) blocked construction permits for a multi-billion dollar oil development in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.**

* The project, known as Willow, by ConocoPhillips was [approved](https://ak.audubon.org/press-release/blm%CA%BCs-final-eis-willow-continues-trump-administration%CA%BCs-arctic-exploitation) by the Trump administration in 2020 and legally [backed](https://www.alaskapublic.org/2021/05/27/biden-administration-throws-support-behind-massive-willow-oil-project-in-npr-a/) by the Biden administration earlier this year. A nonprofit environmental group called Earthjustice [sued](https://earthjustice.org/cases/2021/challenging-the-willow-oil-gas-project-in-alaskas-arctic) last year, arguing the drilling and associated roads would damage essential wildlife habitat for polar bears, migratory birds, caribou, and other species.

* You may remember that ConocoPhillips’ plan [involved](https://www.businessinsider.com/conocophillips-chillers-refreeze-thawing-tundra-climate-change-2020-8) using giant chillers to refreeze thawing permafrost to create a solid drilling surface. Opponents pointed to the hypocrisy of negating the consequences of climate change while simultaneously extracting more fossil fuels that will accelerate climate change.

* Judge Gleason ruled ([PDF](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21045581/210818-willow-order.pdf)) that the Trump administration’s Bureau of Land Management did not adequately conduct an Environmental Impact Statement, ignoring the effects on climate change and omitting a plan to protect polar bears.

##Wolf hunting

**Numerous states have drastically increased permitted wolf killings after the Trump administration removed federal protection for gray wolf populations.**

* Idaho Governor Brad Little [signed](https://www.kiro7.com/news/trending/idaho-governor-signs-bill-that-will-allow-killing-up-90-states-wolf-population/NXTIGBZ4HFAIFAETVNWZK5EQFY/) Senate Bill 1211 into law in May, allowing the killing of 90% of the state’s wolf population. Hunters can now use ATVs and helicopters to track and kill wolves. Furthermore, newborn wolf pups can be killed if found on private land. The wolf population was estimated to be about 1,500 animals prior to the law taking effect.

* The Montana  Fish and Wildlife Commission [voted](https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2021/aug/26/montana-officials-adopts-new-wolf-hunting-trapping/) to allow neck snaring and trap baiting to increase the amount of wolves killed in the state, following a legislative mandate. Snares and traps are generally opposed by biologists and environmentalists because other species - like the federally protected lynx and grizzly bear - can accidentally be caught and killed. 

* Wisconsin’s Natural Resources Board will [allow](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/aug/14/wisconsin-wolves-hunters-300-kill-limit) 300 wolves to be killed in the second hunt this year, more than doubling the recommended kill limit proposed by its own biologists. Earlier this year, hunters killed at least 216 wolves in three days. The state quota at the time was only 119.

* Conservation groups sent a [letter](https://www.endangered.org/usfws-petitioned-to-review-status-of-gray-wolves-in-montana-idaho/) to Secretary of Interior Deb Haaland on Wednesday, urging the agency to reevaluate the Trump administration’s decision to remove wolf protections.  “With these new, extreme wolf-killing measures, the states are reneging on the management plans they agreed to, and the Service has a duty now to step back in and hold the states accountable,” the Endangered Species Coalition writes.

* However, the Biden administration seems unlikely to restore wolf protections. In a court filing last week, government attorneys [defended](https://www.courthousenews.com/biden-signals-plans-to-uphold-trump-administrations-decision-to-end-gray-wolf-protections/) the removal of Endangered Species Act protections, arguing that gray wolves have met the law’s threshold for recovery.

##Pesticide ban

**The EPA reversed a Trump-era decision not to ban a widely used pesticide that could cause potential developmental issues in children.**

* Chlorpyrifos is an organophosphate insecticide that was [banned](https://theconversation.com/the-epa-is-banning-chlorpyrifos-a-pesticide-widely-used-on-food-crops-after-14-years-of-pressure-from-environmental-and-labor-groups-166485) for indoor use in early 2000’s. It was still used in agricultural settings, leading to low exposures via fruit and vegetables and higher exposures for farm workers and communities that live near agricultural fields.

* The Trump administration [decided](https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/18/politics/epa-chlorpyrifos/index.html) in 2019 that there was not sufficient evidence to justify a complete ban on the chemical in agriculture. 

* Last week, Biden’s EPA [determined](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-takes-action-address-risk-chlorpyrifos-and-protect-childrens-health) that “ending the use of chlorpyrifos on food will help to ensure children, farmworkers, and all people are protected from the potentially dangerous consequences of this pesticide.”

"[Megathread] I spent 1,000 hours researching climate change. This is what I found.","# Facts:

* Daily we emit 117 million tons of CO2. Global CO2 emissions are 43 billion tons each year. [\[S\]](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-global-greenhouse-gas-emissions)
* As CO2 concentrations build in the atmosphere, infrared light radiated from earth's surface is absorbed by the CO2. Thus trapping heat in earth's atmosphere. This is known as the greenhouse effect. [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect)
* 38% of global CO2 emissions have dissolved in the oceans. When CO2 dissolves in water it forms carbonic acid. This is known as ocean acidification. [\[S\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781856176361000122?via%3Dihub) [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_storage_of_carbon_dioxide) [\[S\]](https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/pubs/outstand/feel2633/feel2633.shtml)
* The ocean has 50 times more CO2 than the atmosphere. The ocean has 39,000 billion tons of CO2. The atmosphere has 750 billion tons of CO2. [\[S\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781856176361000122?via%3Dihub)
* As the ocean becomes more acidic, less CO2 is able to be stored in the water. This leads to CO2 being released from the ocean and sent to the atmosphere. The same goes for ocean temperature. As water temperature rises, less CO2 is able to stay dissolved (e.g. leave a carbonated drink out on a warm day). [\[S\]](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016RG000533)
* As temperatures rise, soil begins to increase the release of carbon in a process known as soil respiration. Researchers estimate soil carbon loss over the 21st century will be equivalent to two decades of carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels. [\[S\]](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aan2874)

# Solutions:

* **Ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE):** Use mafic and ultramafic rocks (olivine, peridotite, etc.) to bind to CO2 and form carbonates. Thus converting CO2 into an alkaline carbonate mineral. These carbonates could then be placed in the ocean to raise the pH and bring it back to normal levels, and increase CO2 storage capacity in the ocean. [\[S\]](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acssuschemeng.0c08561) [\[S\]](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2019.00007/full)
* **Direct air capture (DAC):** Use large fans to concentrate CO2 into a chamber and then absorb the CO2 by various means. The CO2 can be converted into a long term storage medium such as a carbonate or left as vapor CO2. In the case of vapor CO2 there is some commercial value or it can be pumped into geological wells for storage. [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_air_capture)
* **Renewable energy:** Wind, solar, geothermal, wave/tidal/marine power, etc. [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy)
* **Cultured meats:** Growing meat from cell cultures instead of factory farming. This would free up billions of acres globally, democratize access to protein sources, and eliminate CO2 and CH4 emissions associated with factory farming. In the United States 41% of land use goes towards grazing and animal feed crops. These areas of land are usually high in sunlight and could be used for solar, wind, afforestation, or DAC. [\[S\]](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/land-use-land-value-tenure/major-land-uses/) [\[S\]](https://cellbasedtech.com/lab-grown-meat-companies) [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_agriculture)
* **Reducing fossil fuel emissions:** This can be done by scrubbing some of the CO2 from the source before emitting it to the atmosphere. [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_scrubber)
* **Afforestation:** Afforestation is the establishment of a forest in an area where there was no previous tree cover. Tree-planting campaigns are sometimes criticized for targeting areas where forests would not naturally occur, such as grassland and savanna biomes. Afforestation can negatively affect ecosystems through increasing fragmentation, edge effects, and making the surface albedo darker (especially in northern regions). [\[S\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afforestation)
* **Other:** nuclear [fission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_III_reactor)/[fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITER), [enhanced crop weathering](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2448-9), [solar shield at L1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_sunshade), [ocean afforestation](https://www.marinebiomass.com/), [cloud seeding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_seeding), [ocean fertilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_fertilization), large scale albedo alterations, painting arctic rocks white, dispersing low density CO2 absorbents.

\[pasting the text here b/c link is paywalled\]

Staggering. Unnerving. Mind-boggling. Absolutely gobsmackingly bananas.

As global temperatures shattered records and reached dangerous new highs over and over the past few months, my climate scientist colleagues and I [have](https://twitter.com/ed_hawkins/status/1709825752705753105) just about run out of adjectives to describe what we have seen. Data from [Berkeley Earth](https://berkeleyearth.org/september-2023-temperature-update/) released on Wednesday shows that September was an astounding 0.5 degree Celsius (almost a full degree Fahrenheit) hotter than the prior record, and July and [August](https://berkeleyearth.org/august-2023-temperature-update/) were around 0.3 degree Celsius (0.5 degree Fahrenheit) hotter. 2023 is almost certain to be the hottest year since reliable global records began in the mid-1800s and probably for the [past 2,000 years](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0400-0) (and [well before that](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/july-2023-is-hottest-month-ever-recorded-on-earth/)).

While natural weather patterns, including a [growing El Niño event](https://iri.columbia.edu/our-expertise/climate/forecasts/enso/current/), are playing an important role, the record global temperatures we have experienced this year could not have occurred without the approximately 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) of [warming to date](https://climatechangetracker.org/igcc) from human sources of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. And while many experts have been cautious about acknowledging it, there is increasing evidence that global warming has accelerated over the past 15 years rather than continued at a gradual, steady pace. That acceleration means that the effects of climate change we are already seeing — extreme heat waves, wildfires, rainfall and sea level rise — will only grow more severe in the coming years.

I don’t make this claim lightly. Among my colleagues in climate science, there are sharp divisions on this question, and [some](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/environment/article/2023/07/23/climate-crisis-warming-is-right-in-line-with-early-predictions-but-many-of-the-impacts-are-exceeding-predictions_6063986_114.html) aren’t convinced it’s happening. Climate scientists generally focus on longer-term changes over decades rather than year-to-year variability, and some of my peers in the field have expressed concerns about overinterpreting short-term events like the extremes we’ve seen this year. In the past I doubted acceleration was happening, in part because of a long debate about whether global warming had paused from 1998 to 2012. In hindsight, that was [clearly not the case](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature22315). I’m worried that if we don’t pay attention today, we’ll miss what are increasingly clear signals.

I wouldn’t be making this argument if I didn’t have strong evidence to back it up; the data we’re getting from three sources tells a worrying story about a world warming more quickly than before. First, the rate of warming we’ve measured over the world’s land and oceans over the past 15 years has been 40 percent higher than the rate since the 1970s, with the past nine years being the nine warmest years on record. Second, there has been [acceleration](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/35/14/JCLI-D-21-0895.1.xml) over the past few decades in the total heat content of Earth’s oceans, where over 90 percent of the energy trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is accumulating. Third, [satellite measurements](https://ceres.larc.nasa.gov/science/) of Earth’s energy imbalance — the difference between energy entering the atmosphere from the sun and the amount of heat leaving — show [a strong increase](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/15/2295/2023/essd-15-2295-2023.html) in the amount of heat trapped over the past two decades. If Earth’s energy imbalance is increasing over time, it should drive an increase in the world’s rate of warming.

There are a number of factors driving the acceleration of warming. While the world has [made real progress](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/10/25/climate/world-climate-pledges-cop26.html) in slowing down the growth of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, they have yet to peak and decline. And on top of this, we are reaping the results of what the climate scientist James Hansen [calls](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/30/opinion/columnists/the-faustian-bargain-of-reducing-air-pollution.html) our “Faustian bargain” with air pollution. For decades, air pollution from sulfur dioxide and other hazardous substances in fossil fuels has had a strong temporary cooling effect on our climate. But as countries around the world have begun to clean up the air, the cooling effect provided by these aerosols has [fallen by around 30 percent](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/15/2295/2023/essd-15-2295-2023.html) since 2000. Aerosols have fallen even more in the past three years, after a decision to largely [phase out sulfur](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-how-low-sulphur-shipping-rules-are-affecting-global-warming/) in marine fuels in 2020. These reductions in pollution on top of continued increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations mean that we are encountering some of the unvarnished force of climate change for the first time.

Until recently, climate change was framed as an issue that would affect our children. Today it is nearly omnipresent, and it is impossible to ignore. And very soon, with the acceleration, we will experience even more of its effects: Ice sheets and glaciers will melt faster, extreme weather events will become more frequent, and even more plants and animals will be put at risk of extinction.

Does this acceleration mean that warming is happening faster than we thought or that it is too late to avoid the worst impacts? Not necessarily. Amazingly enough, this acceleration quite closely matches [what climate models have](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/chapter/chapter-4/) projected for this period. In other words, scientists have long foreseen a possible acceleration of warming if our aerosol emissions declined while our greenhouse gas emissions did not. That’s what we’re now seeing. This may not make you feel much better about the future of warming but should at least make you feel better about our models and the power of science to prepare us for what’s to come.

It’s now clear that we can control how warm the planet gets over the coming decades. Climate models have [consistently found](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-will-global-warming-stop-as-soon-as-net-zero-emissions-are-reached/) that once we get emissions down to net zero, the world will largely stop warming; there is no warming that is inevitable or [in the pipeline](https://www.theclimatebrink.com/p/warming-in-the-pipeline-decoding) after that point. Of course, the world will not cool back down for many centuries, unless world powers join in major efforts [to remove](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-what-the-new-ipcc-report-says-about-how-to-limit-warming-to-1-5c-or-2c/) more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than we add. But that is the brutal math of climate change and the reason we need to speed up efforts to reduce emissions significantly.

On that front, there is some reason for [cautious hope](https://swac.umn.edu/events/kuehnast-lecture-2022). The world is on the brink of a clean energy transition. The International Energy Agency [recently estimated](https://www.iea.org/news/the-path-to-limiting-global-warming-to-1-5-c-has-narrowed-but-clean-energy-growth-is-keeping-it-open) that a whopping $1.8 trillion will be invested in clean energy technologies like renewables, electric cars and heat pumps in 2023, up from [roughly $300 billion](https://about.bnef.com/blog/global-low-carbon-energy-technology-investment-surges-past-1-trillion-for-the-first-time/) a decade ago. Prices of solar, wind and batteries have plummeted over the past 15 years, and for much of the world, solar power is now the [cheapest form of electricity](https://www.carbonbrief.org/solar-is-now-cheapest-electricity-in-history-confirms-iea/). If we reduce emissions quickly, we can switch from a world in which warming is accelerating to one in which it’s slowing. Eventually, we can stop it entirely.

We are far from on track to meet our climate goals, and much more work remains. But the positive steps we’ve made over the past decade should reinforce to us that progress is possible and despair is counterproductive. Despite the recent acceleration of warming, humans remain firmly in the driver’s seat, and the future of our climate is still up to us to decide.

Elon Musk's revised view on Climate Change,"Musk-fans, perhaps even EV fanatics, might want to look away.  In his interview with DJT yesterday, Musk talked of CO2 emissions and mentioned only a concern if atmospheric levels reach 1000 ppm (\~420 ppm currently), in which case it can affect your breathing (think ""breath into paper bag"" to fix hyperventilation) or even give headaches for some people.  He made no mention of the greenhouse gas effect and Climate Change.

Climate change : where we're at now and where we're heading,"Warning : this is a long post, and you may find the information inside distressing.

I have spent the past few months reading about climate change, to understand where we're at now and where we are heading. I wanted to share my research, the goal is not to give you an exact timeline of societal collapse or human extinction, but to present the data I have found. If  you are knowledgeable about any of these subjects and think it's bad science or that I have misinterpreted it, I'd be glad if you corrected me. What I'm seeing is way more severe and faster than the worst case scenario of the IPCC, [RCP8.5](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-011-0149-y#Sec9) which predicts 2°C by 2046-2065 and 3.7°C by 2081-2100. But remember, [the IPCC has consistently underestimated the pace and intensity of climate change](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-the-ipcc-underestimated-climate-change/).

In 2021, we emitted [40.8 billion tons of greenhouses gases](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-review-co2-emissions-in-2021-2), and our emissions have never been so high. The amount of energy we're adding to the system is unbelievable. [We are adding the equivalent of 400.000 Hiroshima bombs to the system every day, 365 days a year](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/07/global-warming-of-oceans-equivalent-to-an-atomic-bomb-per-second). If it takes you ten minute to read this thread, imagine that 10.000 Hiroshima exploded around you during that time. We have been doing that for decades, but so far most of the warming has been absorbed [by the oceans](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1808838115).  

[We are currently at 1.1°C of warming](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/global-temperatures) compared to the 1880 baseline. Before the industrial revolution, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere was around 280PPM. As I write these lines, at the beginning of September 2022, we are at 416PPM of CO2. CO2 is not the only greenhouse gas, we must also add methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), [which gives us a total equivalent of 508PPM CO2e](https://gml.noaa.gov/aggi/aggi.html). Note that despite all the climate conferences, the supposed transition to renewable energy, emissions are not decreasing, [but still rising](https://imgur.com/a/jcqZVmC). The rise in greenhouse gases emission [has been exponential](https://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/144105.pdf), doubling every 37 years since the start of the Industrial Revolution. This is because our global economic system is based on cheap fossil fuels and infinite economic growth. Even the United Nations Framework for Climate Change calls for infinite growth, [see article 3 paragraph 5](https://unfccc.int/files/essential_background/background_publications_htmlpdf/application/pdf/conveng.pdf).

The last time concentrations were this high was during the Pliocene, 3 to 5 million years ago.  [This paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1809600115) explains that in the near future, by the 2030s, our climate in most places will resemble that of the Pliocene. What was the Earth like during the Pliocene? Temperatures were on average 2 to 3 degrees higher than today. There was no sea ice in the Arctic, [at least at the beginning of the Pliocene](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms6608) Sea level was 20-30 meters higher. Bye bye New York, Venice, Bangkok, Tokyo, Amsterdam, Lagos, and so many other cities. In 2007, [40% of the world's population lived less than 100km from the coast](https://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/natlinfo/indicators/methodology_sheets/oceans_seas_coasts/pop_coastal_areas.pdf). The ideal CO2 concentration under which humanity flourished was at 280 ppm. The levels of CO2 we have now will have [major consequences on agriculture](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-020-00195-4). The change in temperatures will reduce crop yield and make it impossible to feed our global population. 

According to this paper, [without the aerosol masking effect we may already be at 1.6°C or 2.1°C](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/2017GL076079). Our emissions of greenhouse gases also reduce temperatures thanks to aerosols, but while greenhouses gases stay in the atmosphere for decades or millennia, aerosols only stay for a few days or weeks. Once industrial activity shuts down, which it will at some point because it depends on finite fossil fuels, we will rapidly gain 0.5 to 1 degree of warming. This is way too fast for any form of complex life to adapt to. 

This is where we are now. If we have not yet reached the climatic conditions of the Pliocene, it is because there is a delay between greenhouse gas emissions and their effects on the climate, and there are still negative feedback loops, such as carbon sinks or ice caps at the poles which are (for now) slowing runaway climate change. I will come back to this later in this thread, now let's look at the future.

The emissions reduction targets of most countries are laughable. I'm pretty sure we are already well past 1.5°c, but let's imagine it was still possible, [this how fast emissions would need to drop if we wanted to stay below 1.5°C](https://imgur.com/a/6HecrDT). How do we go from 40.8 billion tons of CO2 to 0 in just a few years? China pledged to get to ""net zero"" [by 2060](https://www.unpri.org/pri-blog/the-net-zero-transition-in-china-progress-has-been-made-but-challenges-remain/10132.article), [India by 2070](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-59125143). Does that seem to be in line with the 1.5°C target? And ""net zero"" is bullshit too, it relies on shady accounting techniques, like ""we'll keep emitting but we'll plant trees so it will compensate!"", and it also relies on technology like carbon capture which has not even proven to be effective. 

Even if we forget the aerosols we mentioned earlier, [current emissions take us to 1.5°C between 2026 and 2032 and 2C by between 2034 and 2043](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-when-might-the-world-exceed-1-5c-and-2c-of-global-warming/). [Not a single country of the G20, the world’s biggest polluters, is on track to meet its targets]( https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/15/world/climate-pledges-insufficient-cat-intl/index.html), so 2°C is clearly dead.  I don't know how realistic the estimates from Carbon Brief are, we could reach 1.5°C and 2°C even earlier, because of feedback loops we don't know about or underestimate. 

The idea that we should aim to stay below 1.5°C or 2°C had no basis in science anyway. [It was the brainchild of William Nordhaus, an American economist from Yale University](https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/why-did-ipcc-choose-2deg-c-goal-limiting-global-warming), who doesn't understand economics nor the climate. It was all based on what he thought capitalism could get away with. The predecessor of the UNFCC, the United Nations Advisory Group on Greenhouse Gases, declared on page 8 of their October 1990 report that : “[Warming beyond 1°C may elicit rapid, unpredictable and non-linear responses that could lead to extensive ecosystem damages]( https://mediamanager.sei.org/documents/Publications/SEI-Report-TargetsAndIndicatorsOfClimaticChange-1990.pdf)”. Climate speaker David Spratt, in his 2008 book “Climate Code  Red: The  Case for  Emergency Action”, [mentions that according to scientific research, a rise in temperature even under 0.5°C is enough to trigger feedback loops causing runaway climate change]( https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46142232_Beyond_Politics_and_Business_as_Usual_Review_of_David_Spratt_and_Philip_Sutton's_'Climate_Code_Red')

Now onto the tipping points. [This paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1810141115) shows that 2°C could lead to 5°C, even without human intervention. I can't give you an exact timeline here, but nature doesn't do linear, it does exponential. Temperatures have risen faster each decade, and with all these feedback loops, I don't see why it would slow down instead of accelerating. 

At the same time, we are losing carbon sinks, which absorbed some emissions and slowed climate change. So far, [the Ocean has absorbed 93% of the increase in temperatures](https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2016-046_0.pdf). If all the greenhouses gases we have emitted had gone to the atmosphere instead of the Ocean, temperatures would have risen by 36°C instead of 1.1°C. I can't overstate how crazy that is. But the oceans are [losing their ability to be a carbon sink](https://en.unesco.org/news/unesco-cautions-ocean-risks-losing-its-ability-absorb-carbon-exacerbating-global-warming), which means more greenhouse gases will go straight to the atmosphere. 

Our forests are yet another carbon sink that we are losing. For example, the Amazon used to be an important carbon sink, which means it took CO2 out of the atmosphere, [but it now contributes to CO2 emissions](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03629-6), because of massive deforestation and rising temperatures. In the near future, [the Amazon will turn into a Savannah](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/05/amazon-near-tipping-point-of-switching-from-rainforest-to-savannah-study). 

Phytoplankton produces [50 to 80% of the oxygen on earth](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/ocean-oxygen.html), way more than is produced by trees, and it is the basis for all food webs in the ocean and many food webs on land. But [it has been steadily declining for decades](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09268), and we have already wiped out 40% of the [phytoplankton](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/phytoplankton-population/). 

The ice is in the arctic could be gone [as early as the 2030s, and perhaps even earlier](https://www.scientistswarning.org/2022/01/12/arctic-death-spiral/). This is the “Blue Ocean event”. Its consequences will be catastrophic, to put it mildly. The main consequence of an ice-free arctic is that dark blue open ocean is much less reflective than sea ice, which leads to significantly more solar radiation being absorbed.  In short, an ice-free Arctic means the beginning of the end of cooling, because huge amounts of sunlight won’t get reflected back into space anymore, resulting in much more warming. With less Arctic ice the planet’s ability to cool itself becomes more and more uncertain.

With rising ocean temperatures, [billions of tonnes of frozen methane could rise from the seabed and cook the surface of the planet](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/05/soaring-ocean-temperature-is-greatest-hidden-challenge-of-our-generation). This could occur even if emissions are drastically cut, due to the lag time between emitting greenhouse gases and their visible consequences. This is really really bad because while methane only stays in the atmosphere for a few decades, [it is 86 times more potent than CO2](https://www.carbonbrief.org/scientists-concerned-by-record-high-global-methane-emissions/#:~:text=tells%20Carbon%20Brief.-,Methane%20budget,as%20powerful%20over%20100%20years).

There is also an estimated 1.7 trillion tons of carbon locked into the permafrost in the polar regions of Alaska, Canada, Northern Europe and Siberia.  [Research shows that up to 70% of permafrost could be lost by 2100]( https://phys.org/news/2018-12-permafrost-climate.html), and probably much earlier given that feedback loops reinforce each other. 

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWoiBpfvdx0) give you an idea of what a 5°C world looks like.

It doesn't stop there though. At 4-5 degrees, [subtropical marine clouds could cease to form](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0310-1). That loss is enough to raise the global mean temperature by another 8°C, on top of what we’ve already added. That means at least a whopping 12°C, we're talking Jurassic temperatures here. And even that may be conservative, because there could be so many other feedback loops we don't know about or underestimate.

There are other feedback loops that I didn't research : The slowing of the AMOC, jet stream disruption, water vapor... Guy McPherson (whatever one might think of him) found at least 64 feedback loops before he stopped counting. There are so many, I encourage you to do your own research. The climate is a really complex system and we have have completely disrupted it.

In short, we are increasing our CO2 emissions exponentially, we are losing our carbon sinks, and we are unleashing feedback loops that will accelerate climate change even faster. Exponential curves, remember. 

There is also the human factor : How much more GHG will we emit and at what speed? Will there be a nuclear exchange? Nuclear power plants all over the world could meltdown. It takes incredible amounts of time to decommission a power plant properly, and we seem to have very little time. Will we see a global nuclear meltdown that could even strip the ozone layer through radiation? 

Again, I can’t give a timeline, I am not a scientist or a prophet, just someone who read a lot of scientific papers. But it seems that the rise of change is happening faster than expected and it keeps accelerating. I really don’t see this leading us to anywhere but human extinction in the near future, along with societal collapse and widescale human suffering before that. Could it happen by 2026, 2030 or 2040? Even earlier, or later? I don't know, but it's always faster than expected.",collapse,515,194,https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/x4q0mn/climate_change_where_were_at_now_and_where_were/

"Science AMA Series: I am Bill Moomaw, Professor Emeritus of International Environmental Policy at Tufts University, and Chair of the Science Committee at Earthwatch Institute. I have worked on solutions to climate change since 1988 and I will be addressing the recent Paris negotiations. AMA!","Hi Reddit,

Last year, I retired from Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy (the only chemist on the faculty!), where I founded and directed the Center for International Environment and Resource Policy (<http://fletcher.tufts.edu/CIERP>) for 22 years. I supervised many masters’ and doctoral students during that time, including the co-chair of the Paris climate negotiations. I continue to work on climate science and policy, energy, water, forests and oceans to develop scientifically valid and effective strategies and policies. I served as a lead author on five IPCC reports over a 19-year period. Until recently I served as Chief Scientist at Earthwatch Institute (<http://earthwatch.org/>) and continue to serve as the Chair of their Science Committee. I also serve on the board of directors of Woods Hole Research Center (<http://whrc.org/>), ranked as the most influential climate think tank for the past two years, and several additional environmental science and consensus building organizations.

The science of climate change is complex, and the politics are more so. I have always found the interaction between the two to be fascinating, and remember being shocked as a young scientist that science did not always determine the political outcome of a policy process. I want to share with you the role of science in the outcome of the Paris climate negotiation that just ended on December 11th, 2015.

A bit of history: back in the 1980s, a group of scientists convinced some governments that based on their research, the release of heat trapping gases into the atmosphere would heat the earth to a point where there could be uncontrollable and irreversible warming with devastating consequences for all life, including humans. This science prompted two actions. The first was to create the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to provide scientific input to governments on the science, impacts, vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation of climate change. The second was to negotiate an international treaty, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change that was signed by 154 nations in 1992. The Paris negotiations were the 21st meeting of the parties to the original treaty, and its actions both utilized and ignored science in the final outcome.

I invite you to join me in a discussion about how science and policy came together and diverged over issues like the 2oC global temperature goal during the recent Paris talks.

I'll be back at 1 pm EST (10 AM PST, 6 pm UTC) to answer your questions, ask me anything!

**EDIT IN CLOSING:**

Thank you all for your engagement, and your thoughtful questions. It has been very gratifying to hear your concerns. Let me close with one final thought. So many actions to address climate change have many additional benefits for providing sustainable energy to all and lift people out of poverty. There would be far less damage to the planet and our health if we can make the shift away form fossil fuels. As I said earlier, we also need to do Restorative Development to mobilize the biosphere so that we improve our forests and land quality every time we use them instead of constantly degrading them. Perhaps, you will enjoy one of my favorite cartoons as a closing.

We know climate change is happening. We need not only to make changes but also plan for it!,"This is maybe more of just a rant but I hope it starts some conversations or thoughts.
I’m a civil engineer by education and have been out of school and design for a while so maybe things have changed but we need to be proactive in our plans for future development in a way that future proofs us knowing the inevitability of the future (and perhaps not knowing much more than that in terms of what the future actually looks like). 

It’s frustrating as heck that there’s “deniers” out there. But let’s bring ourselves back to reality a bit. It’s happening. It’s going to get worse. We don’t know where it’s going to land and what the ultimate outcomes will be, but what we do know is the local environment will be different, some places more than others. Crops, harvesting, coastlines, water levels. Typically in construction and stormwater design we plan for “100 year flood events”, with the assumptions that the storm will happen once in 100 years. Those probabilities are much higher now and we need to start integrating the next layers of protections for ourselves if we have any chance in communities surviving long enough to implement the changes needed to slow this down or even keep ourselves here.

Here’s one example in a nearby town to me.  New multi million dollar wastewater treatment plan investment. Part of the development plan talks about relocating it to deal with sea level rise (yet if you look at the planned location it’s less than 1m higher above sea level than the current plant….). So many other things wrong with this proposal (zero community engagement, lack of due diligence on cost benefits of proposed location or alternates). More info in the link and I have more info if your curious (please feel free to sign if reading 😉)

Anyway what can we be doing to get in front of what’s inevitably happening? Have design standards changed with this in mind? If not how do we change it? Why do we inherently plan as if the state of right now is permanent?

A majority of people in Northern Ireland believe extreme weather events like the recent Storm Éowyn are at least partly caused by climate change. However, there is a significant difference when it comes to nationalist and unionist voters.

Just 29% of unionist voters believe this to be the case, while 81% of nationalist/republican supporters agree that climate change is partly responsible.

This is according to the latest LucidTalk poll for the Belfast Telegraph, which used a weighted representative sample of 1,050 people who responded to the survey.

It comes after[ Storm Éowyn brought winds of more than 90mph ](https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/republic-of-ireland/thousands-still-without-power-weeks-after-storm-eowyn/a1585768706.html)and caused severe disruption across Northern Ireland last month.

Stormont’s Department for Infrastructure (DfI) said its workers had to clear more than 2,300 obstructions on our roads, while around 285,000 households lost power.

Broadband services were also affected, with 600 Fibrus customers still without access, as of Sunday.

The LucidTalk survey asked people: “Do you think weather events like Storm Éowyn are at least partially caused by climate change?”

Some 60% of respondents said yes and 31% said no, while 9% reported having no opinion, weren’t sure or didn’t know.

Looking at the results by age group, those between 18 and 34 were most likely to agree that climate change is partly responsible for extreme weather, with 71% saying this is the case, compared to 47% of those aged 45 to 54, some 58% of those aged 35 and 44 and 59% of those aged 55 to 64. Some 60% of respondents aged over 65 agreed that climate change is partly to blame.

In terms of respondents by voting block, 81% of nationalist/republican voters answered yes to the question posed, while 12% said no and 7% said they didn’t know, weren’t sure or had no opinion.

Among unionist voters, 29% said climate change was partially responsible for extreme weather, 57% said it wasn’t and 14% said they didn’t know, weren’t sure or had no opinion.

Some 92% of respondents who classed themselves as non-assigned or constitutionally neutral supported the view regarding climate change, while 7% said they did not and just 1% said they didn’t know, weren’t sure or had no opinion.

For those undetermined or ‘unidentified’, the figures were 40%, 49% and 11%, respectively.

Storm Éowyn was the first time a red weather warning was put in place across both Northern Ireland and the Republic since the colour warning system was in place in both jurisdictions.

It resulted in schools being closed, flights cancelled and many businesses shutting their doors.

Two weeks ago, Stormont Finance Minister John O’Dowd [announced that £17.4m was to be provided to the various departments ](https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/stormont-executive-allocates-over-17m-to-deal-with-impact-of-storm-eowyn/a674228753.html)to help them deal with the impact of the storm.

Almost half of this, some £8m, was allocated to DfI, while £4m went to the Department of Health and £3m went to the Department of Education.

A further £1.4m was allocated to the Department for Communities and £1m was provided to the Department of Justice.

“Given the unforeseen costs and exceptional challenges facing departments as they deal with the aftermath of the storm, the limited funding available had to be prioritised for this purpose,” Mr O’Dowd said upon the announcement.

“I appreciate the other financial pressures faced by departments and am committed to working together with my Executive colleagues to address the challenges ahead.”",northernireland,38,111,https://www.reddit.com/r/northernireland/comments/1ixptgc/just_29_of_unionist_voters_believe_climate_change/

After a quick comparison I switched banks and the services and terms are (almost) identical, so it didn't affect my personal life at all. I'm sure many countries have these kind of comparison tools.

Edit: 
Since many people asked, here is the link to the website I used https://eerlijkegeldwijzer.nl/bankwijzer/banken/ It's in Dutch and only for banks in the Netherlands.

Here is a link https://bank.green/ someone listed in the comments where you can see for banks from loads of different countries (I don't know how reliable it is for each country) how green they; what their impact on climate change is.

Here is a link https://www.fossilbanks.org/fossil-banks someone listed where you can see how much some banks have invested in the fossil fuel industry, since they signed the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.

Here is a video by the YT channel Climate Town regarding this topic, which many people linked in the comments: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ7W6HFHPYs",LifeProTips,8988,449,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/vi5eqj/lpt_if_you_care_about_gender_equality_corruption/
